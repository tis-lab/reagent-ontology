        <obo:IAO_0000112>another very good example of how this property is used differently than the generic &apos;comment&apos; property is found on the &apos;cell subculturing&apos; class</obo:IAO_0000112>
        <obo:IAO_0000112>Another example clarifies the scope of the techniques branch : &apos;techniques in scope here should be those related to reagents (ie material processing techniques used to generate a reagent or techniques/assays in which reagents are used).  These classes are referenced as such in logical definitions of reagent classes.&apos;</obo:IAO_0000112>
        <rdfs:comment>This information is intended to aid both end users and developers in understanding at a higher level the approach behind modeling choices in the ontology.  Such annotations are most commonly used for more general classes representing core categories in our ontology (e.g. reagent, cell line, technique), to illuminate the modeling approach where it is not immediately obvious from viewing the class structure in the ontology itself.</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000112>A perfect example of the benefit/use of this annotation property is seen on the &apos;cell line&apos; class, as it is not immediately intuitive how this branch is structured and how it should be used.  To facilitate user understanding , we describe in an &apos;explanation of modeling approach&apos; annotation the rationale behind the cell line hierarchy:  &quot; the primary axis of classification for the cell line hierarchy is based on the distinction between permanent vs primary cell lines, as these represent mutually exclusive categories under which all cell line classes can be asserted.   Accordingly, classes representing established, named cell lines (eg HeLa, PC-12, NIH-3T3) are asserted as children of &apos;permanent cell line&apos; or &apos;primary cell line&apos;.  A range of additional equivalent classes (e.g. clonal cell line, expression cell line, disease-model cell line) have also been created and logically defined, such that asserted classes representing named cell lines can be classified into multiple categories based on the axioms describing their respective attributes.  Similarly, instances of cell lines described in databases or catalogs using this model can be similarly classified in along multiple dimensions.</obo:IAO_0000112>
        <obo:IAO_0000112>another example of this annotation is on &apos;research material role&apos;</obo:IAO_0000112>
        <obo:IAO_0000112>An example of this annotation applied to recording modeling rules or conventions is found on the &apos;research material role&apos; class : All research materials described in this ontology should be asserted to have some kind of research material role (a reagent role, a specimen role, a scientific instrument or device role, or a research agent role). This is important for the planned processes used to generate them to classify as material processing technique, whcih is defined as having output some research material.</obo:IAO_0000112>
        <obo:IAO_0000115>Used to explain high level modeling approaches regarding a certain class or hierarchy - in particular, the rationale for decisions regarding:

(1) Class definitions (ie explains key definitional criteria and intended scope/usage of the class in the context of the global modeling approach or in relation to other classes) (vs IAO:comment which is to be used to clarify the textual definition without such global context)

(2) Expected logical entailments (ie how the modeling approach facilitates desired logical inferencing)

(3) Hierarchy design (ie explains axes choosen for asserted vs equivalent class implementation, significance of hierarchical modeling in context of the ontology, why a particular class structure was choosen over alternative approaches)</obo:IAO_0000115>

Their tools/algorithms could conceivable be used to mine the literature and/or vendor catalogs and assign reagent roles to those chemical entities that appear in some pre-defined context in these resources that would suggest them to be reagents.

Where this type of annotation is needed is when one ontology, O1, wishes to re-use a class from another ontology (O2), and the developers of O1 wish to use a different label in their ontology from that used in O2.  This could be a meaningful and beneficial use of an annotation property such as this, if it were definedand/or renamed to be used in such a way.

        <rdfs:comment>This property is functional because it is defined as a relation that holds between instances, not classes. At an instance level, a dependent continuant inheres_in only one individual. Thus, at an instance level, if some quality or role or function is asserted to inhere in more than one thing, then it should be the case that these things are equivalent</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>A relation between a dependent continuant D and an entity E. D inheres_in E iff: given any d that instantiates D at t, there exists some e that instantiates E at t and d *inheres_in* e at t. Here *inheres_in* is the primitive instance level relation.</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <rdfs:comment>This relation links qualities, functions, dispositions and other dependent continuants to their bearers. Examples: A particular shape that inheres in a lung; The redness that ineres in a Drosophila eye; Catalytic activity function inheres_in catalytic molecule. Note that inherence is a functional relation: if x inheres_in y at t and x inheres_in z at t, then y=z. We leave open the possibility of a relation multiply_inheres_in, such as between a gene sequence and the multiple chromosomes it multiply inheres in. The super-relation of both inheres_in and multiply_inheres_in would be depends_on</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>This clarifies that only specifically dependent continuants inhere in (specifically) one independent continuant over all time. For GDCs, there in implicitly inherence to all the independent continuants in which the concretizations inhere.

        <obo:REO_0000144>OBI uses the realizes relation for two distinct and different purposes, one of which is wrong.  In ReO, we create a new relation (achieves specification) to replace the incorrect usage.

1. &apos;realizes&apos; is used correctly to relate a process to a realizable entity such as a role or function

2. OBI uses realizes incorrectly to describe the relation between a planned process and a quality&gt;information carrier where the process executes the specified actions described by the directive information content   
- see OBI:study intervention for example:iiis part of&apos; some (&apos;study design execution&apos; and (realizes some (concretizes some &apos;intervention design&apos;)))
		
this is a different type of &apos;realization&apos; than in case #1.  the realization in case #1 applied here would describe the process of physically implementing the &apos;pattern&apos; represented by  information bearer dependent continuant by writing it down, or typing it in a computer.  Importantly, the key difference here is that this process is independent of the directive information content of this information bearer (ie it refers to the physical recording for some directive specification, not the execution of the processes outlined in this specification.)

- presumably there is an implied &apos;information carrier&apos; in this axiom that concretizes the intervention design.  ( &apos;is part of&apos; some (&apos;study design execution&apos; and (realizes some (&apos;information carrier&apos; and concretizes some  intervention design)))

- however, an information carrier is a quality in OBI, and the realizes relation holds between a realizable entity and a process.  this is a problem . . . if it is the information carrier that is being realized, this type of information carrier needs to be a realizable entity, or a different type of realization is occurring (ie different than the idea of a pattern which would be describe by #1) that requires a new relation
	
Proposed solution:
- relate a process to a directive info entity&gt;plan specification such as study design&gt;intervention design using a achieves_specification property (such as that implemented in ReO as a parent of the current OBI property &apos;achieves planned objective&apos; (aka achieves objective specification&apos; in ReO)</obo:REO_0000144>

We leave open the possibility of defining in future the sub-relations directly_realizes (as bewteen a function and it&apos;s functioning) and indirectly_realizes.

        <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">originates_from</rdfs:label>
        <rdfs:comment>A non-transitive child of develops_from, that can be used to express cardinality constraints on a derivation or transformation relation. (similar to the use of has_component when needing to express cardinality constraints on the has_part relation)  

This property is often used in a complex/nested class expression asserting that the material entity A originates from material entity B, which is an input into some process or event that is responsible for the change in identity marking the origination of entity A. For example, the class expression: 

 &apos;clonal cell line&apos; is a &apos;cell line&apos; and (originates_from exactly 1 cell and (is_specified_input_of some &apos;cell culture expansion&apos;)).  

Here, entity A (a clonal cell line) originates from entity B (a cell) through the process of this cell being input into a cell culture expansion process.  This execution of this process marks the point in time when the clional cell line comes into existance.</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000115>A non-transitive relation between two material entities, indicating that entity &apos;A&apos; (and all its parts) can be traced back to one and only one seperate entity &apos;B&apos;, such that at a specific point in time, entity A came into existence through a single derivation or transformation event from entity B.  In such a case, entity A can be said to originate_from entity B. 

Because &apos;originates_from&apos; is non-transitive, entity A can be said to develop_from  but not originate_from any material entity that gave rise to entity B through some previous derivation or transformation process. For example, a clonal cell line can originate_from only one single cell, whose division into two cells represents the derivation event marking the origin of the clonal cell line.  However, becasue the derives_from relation is transitive, this cell line can be said to derive_from not only this single cell, but previous cells from which this cell was derived through earlier cell divisions.  Thus, a given entity A can originate_from only one other material entity, ie the entity from which the original instance of A came into existance  through some derivation or transformation event. </obo:IAO_0000115>

It is clear that a new entity comes into existance from a derivation event, but does an entity come into existance from a transformation? Transformations change the type of an entity, but not its identity . . . so it is unclear if this change in type represence a &apos;coming into existance&apos;.  If it does not, then &apos;originates_from&apos; should be made a non-transitive child of &apos;derives_from&apos;, and used only in cases of derivation where a non-transitive property is needed for use with a cardinality restriction.</obo:IAO_0000116>

Ex: the &apos;molecular target role&apos; exploits a more fundamental &apos;molecular binding function&apos;, as a bearer of the role must also bear the function.

Ex: a &apos;drug role&apos; played by cycloheximde in some experimental context exploits a more fundamental &apos;protein synthesis inhibitor function&apos; with which this molecule is synthesized in some bacteria, which in turn exploits a more fundamental ‘molecular binding disposition&apos;, which in turn exploits some &apos;charged&apos; quality of the molecule.

Ex: a reagent role exploits a more fundamental disposition to participate in a chemical reaction/interaction.</rdfs:comment>

derives_from is used in many different ways:

1. Something large deriving from something smaller which contributes material to it (cell line derives from some cell) . . . i would say this is akin to an &apos;originates_from&apos; relation

2. Something small deriving from larger entity of which it was a part . . . would be akin to a &apos;was_once_part_of&apos; relation  (biological specimen derives from some organism, monoclonal antiody derives from some hybridoma)

3.  derivation at similar scale (eg a modified cell derives from an unmodified cell.  mRNA deriving from pre-mRNA. a protein complex derives from an individual protein) . . .  many of these are arguable transformations


And in ReO I have an example of both #1 and #2 in the same axiom, which really highlights the issue : 

monoclonal antibody:
derives_from some 
    (&apos;hybridoma cell line&apos;
     and (derives_from some 
        (&apos;B cell&apos;
         and (part_of some organism))))

        <obo:REO_0000144>CARO2: If ReO wants to consider things like tissue specimens to be subtypes of anatomical entity&gt;…tissue, then we cannot use CARO anatomical entities because these are necessarily part of an organism!!  but would be nice to have some hierarchical link between tissue specimen and tissue . . . may need to be a derives from link if we use CARO anatomical entities
	
I would prefer that CARO relax its requirement that anatomical entities need to be part of or located in an organism, and rather say that they are part of or derive from an organism in a way that retains their internal structure (ie a liver removed from a  mouse is an anatomical entity&gt; liver, but not once it is homogenized . . . that is, contextual processings retain anatomical identity, but physical processing/experimental modification.  how can we state this logically in owl? (ie that an anatomical entity is located in an organism or derived from an organism through some contextual modification process? . . . .perhaps : is specified output of some contextual processing and has specified input some (part_of some organism) ?

Note that if CARO wants to use CL cell as they suggest in a editor note, then they cannot have this req because CL cell includes cells in vitro
	
If they do not relax this requirement, I can still use CARO but not be able to assert any specimens as children - rather, would related to CARO classes using a derives from relation. Or I can create a reo label  for CARO classes that is &apos;native ___&apos; , and have the more general parent sit outside the CARO anatomical entity hierarchy (for ex, like I did with LC cell and native cell), but this seems like overkill and not needed for ReO.</obo:REO_0000144>

        <rdfs:comment>Opinions and authorities vary as to whether some lipids can be considered to be macromolecules.  Here, we consider lipids to be small molecules, despite the fact that many can be quite large, since they are not true macromolecules in the sense that they are not comprised of repeating monomeric subunits. 
 
The term &apos;lipid&apos; covers a wide range of substances which contain moieties belonging chemically to hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, acids, amines or glucides. Accordingly, lipids cannot be defined structurally, but are rather defined by their chemical proeprties (ie their solubility in non-polar solvents). The majority of lipid  molecules are waxes, triacylglycerols, phospholipids and glycolipids. Other substances are also considered as lipids while belonging to other classes of molecules, e.g. fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K), coenzymes (ubiquinones), pigments (carotenoids), terpenes, phenolics and sterols. (http://www.cyberlipid.org/cyberlip/home0001.htm)</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:REO_0000140>an organic small molecule of biological origin that is soluble in nonpolar solvents, and is comprised primarily of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Lipids include saponifiable lipids, such as glycerides (fats and oils) and phospholipids, as well as nonsaponifiable lipids, principally steroids. </obo:REO_0000140>

Along the way in each of these hierarchies, it is important to indicate whether members of these classes bear concretizations of genetic sequence information.  This is because this criteria is important for distinguishing &apos;chemical reagents&apos; (which do not bear such information) from &apos;protein reagents&apos; and &apos;nucleic acid reagents&apos; (which do bear such information). For this reason, many of the classes below contain an axiom such as &apos;not (has_part some (bearer_of some (is_concretization_of some &apos;genetic sequence region&apos;)))&apos; </obo:REO_0000139>

        <rdfs:comment>Note that here the notion of &apos;modified&apos; is distinct from our notion of &apos;experimentally modified&apos; (where the latter holds that there is some experimental modification process that takes as input some unmodified material entity and outputs a modified variant of this same material entity).  Being &apos;modified&apos; merely reflects some physical variation with respect to some reference object or structure- so modified amino acids can be synthesized de novo, such that there is not necessarily some experimental modification process that takes as input some unmodified amino acid and outputs a modified variant. 

For now we have only claimed the &apos;reference&apos; set of unmodified amino acids to contain the set of canonical amino acid structures. As canonical amino acids are defined strictly by their molecular structures, any modifications will result in a modified, non-canonical amino acid (e.g. even a natural modification such as a phosphorylation).</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>This class includes all amino acids, natural or unnatural, that are functional derivatives of / variants of some as of yet undefiend set of foundational, &apos;unmodified&apos; amino acids (which includes at minimum the set of canonical amino acids).  We acknowledge this definition is vague and imprecise, and are working with ChEBI and others to address this.  However, we implement this class now with the expectation that users will apply common sense to determine if a given amino acid is modified or not.  As a point of reference, see the Sigma catalog entries for &apos;amino acids&apos; (http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/biochemicals/biochemical-products.html?TablePage=16181993) vs &apos;modified amino acids&apos; (http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/biochemicals/biochemical-products.html?TablePage=16360557) </obo:IAO_0000116>

        <rdfs:comment>these are nucleic acid analogs where the ribose-sugar backbone of DNA and RNA is replaced by a backbone composed of repeating N-(2-aminoethyl)-glycine units linked by peptide bonds. The various purine and pyrimidine bases are linked to the backbone by methylene carbonyl bonds.

The name is somewhat of a misnomer as PNA is not an acid. Synthetic peptide nucleic acid oligomers have been used in recent years in molecular biology procedures, diagnostic assays and antisense therapies. Due to their higher binding strength it is not necessary to design long PNA oligomers for use in these roles, which usually require oligonucleotide probes of 20–25 bases</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:REO_0000139>the primary axis of classification for the cell line hierarchy is based on the distinction between permanent vs primary cell lines, as these represent mutually exclusive categories under which all cell line classes can be asserted.   Accordingly, classes representing established, named cell lines (eg HeLa, PC-12, NIH-3T3) are asserted as children of &apos;permanent cell line&apos; or &apos;primary cell line&apos;.  A number of additional equivalent classes (e.g. clonal cell line, expression cell line, disease-model cell line) have also been created and logically defined, such that asserted classes representing named cell lines can be classified into multiple categories based on the axioms describing their respective attributes.  Similarly, instances of cell lines described in databases or catalogs using this model can be similarly classified in along multiple dimensions.</obo:REO_0000139>

        <obo:IAO_0000116>Class Naming Conventions:
1. The term &apos;primary&apos; is avoided in the preferred label as it has different meanings in different communities (can mean &apos;not yet  passaged&apos; or &apos;no immortalized&apos;). In communities where this is the case, users can choose to apply the term &apos;primary&apos; in their applications as they desire.  However, in ReO we avoid the use of &apos;primary&apos; due to its ambiguity (we do however make &apos;primary cell culture&apos; an alternative term for &apos;unpassaged cell culture&apos;, since there is no dispute that such a culture qualifies as primary).

2. The term &apos;line&apos; is also subject to varied interpretation (can refer to a culture that is immortalized, or  a culture that has been passaged).  Here, we use &apos;line&apos; only in cases where the culture has been immortalized, and use &apos;culture&apos; in labels of classes that are not immortal.</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:REO_0000300>All particular multicellular organism cell culture classes (eg HeLa, 3T3, HEK293, etc) should be asserted under the immortal cell line or mortal cell culture branches, and axioms added to allow classification under appropriate equivalent classes. </obo:REO_0000300>

        <obo:IAO_0000116>There are no &apos;passaged&apos; or &apos;unpassaged&apos; immortal cell line subclasses here (as there are for mortal cell cultures), as it is presumed that passaging is part of the immortalization process.  However, if we say that immortal cell lines can be created through culturing of a cell or cell population that has been immortalized &apos;naturally&apos; through an in vivo malignant transformation, then it would be possible to have a unpassaged immortal cell line.  This, however, we believe to be a very rare outlier, as all such cell lines are typically passaged multiple times before their use in an experiment to &apos;establish&apos; the line and define its growth conditions. Thus, we include an axiom that all immortal cell lines are output of some cell passaging.

The cells are wild-type for the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP). This cell line along with the PEA 10 (see ATCC CRL-2215) and PEA 13 (see ATCC CRL-2216) cell lines constitute a genetically defined system to study the endocytosis of ligands by the LRP. The above cell lines are the only available experimental system to study the effect of LRP deficiency because LRP deficient mouse embryos die in utero. </obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:REO_0000139>Classification Axes for the Cell Hierarchy:

Asserted Class Hierarchies: primary asserted classification is based on a split between &apos;multicellular organism cell&apos; and &apos;unicellular organism&apos; (note that unicellular organism &apos;cells&apos; are asserted as organisms in the organism branch, and inferred to be cells).  

Equivalent Class Hierarchies : alternate classification is basd on experimental context of the cell, and include a &apos;cell in vitro&apos; vs &apos;native cell&apos; split, and also &apos;experimentally modified cell&apos; and &apos;cell antibody target&apos;.

Further subclassing below this first level is done based on the in vivo/environment vs ex vivo/ex environment distinction.  A third level is then based on experimental modification (unmodified cells vs experimentally modified cells)</obo:REO_0000139>
        <obo:REO_0000300>Axiomatization Conventions for &apos;Cell&apos; Classes: Use the axiomatization recommendations below to achieve inferred classification under appropriate equivalent class hierarchies.

Parthood : declaring if members of the cell class is part of an organism (in case of multicellular organism cells),  part of an environment (in case of unicellular organisms), or &apos;grain of&apos; some type of cell culture, will allow inferred classification under the &apos;cell in vitro&apos; hierarchy.

Participation : declaring a type of planned process from which members of a cell class may be output from (in particular, any cell modification techniques) will enable inferred classification in &apos;experimentally modified cell&apos; hierarchy.

For example, see the recently created (8-20-12) &apos;experimentally transformed cell line cell&apos; class - which is asserted as a type of multicellular organism cell and given the axioms&apos;(is_specified_output_of some &apos;cell culture cell transformation&apos;)&apos;   and &apos;&apos;is grain of&apos; some &apos;immortal cell line&apos; &apos;   to allow proper classification as a type of &apos;immortal cell line cell&apos;.</obo:REO_0000300>
        <obo:IAO_0000231>unclear from the definition of cell in CARO and CL whether their being an anatomical structure requires that they are part of an organism.  until  this resolved, will use a REO:cell class as placeholder to subsume both cell in vivo and cell ex vivo</obo:IAO_0000231>

        <obo:IAO_0000116>We recommend avoiding use of the term &apos;primary&apos;, as to some this means &apos;yet to be passaged&apos; and for others it means &apos;not immortalized&apos;.  Thus we recommend the label &apos;mortal cell culture cell&apos; rather than ‘primary cell line cell’.
 
Note also that in ReO we view the term &apos;culture&apos; as more general than &apos;line&apos;, where culture covers all types of cultures (mortal and immortal), while ‘line’ is used in labels only for cell cultures that are immortalized.  This is because, as with the term ‘primary’, there is varied use of the term ‘line’.  To some it means ‘any cell culture that has been passaged’, and to others it means ‘any cell culture that can be propagated long term (ie immortalized)’.  So, while there may be disagreement that a passaged but mortal culture is a cell line, all would agree that an immortalized culture is a cell line.  Thus our use of the labels ‘mortal cell culture cell’ and ‘immortal cell line cell’.</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <rdfs:comment>while cultured multicellular organism cells are considered to be experimentally modfied, they are not considered to be cells ex vivo, as &apos;ex vivo&apos; is conceived of as &apos;having once been part of an organism&apos;, and a given cell culture cell has not at any point in its existence been a part of some organism.

        <obo:IAO_0000116>For now, have made the choice to assert antibody reagents as types of &apos;GO:Ig complex, circulating&apos;, because structurally, this is most accurate. . . . however, the def of the GO class would have to be changed to invoke only structural differentia for this to be entirely accurate, as subclasses of antibody in ReO (e.g. &apos;antibody reagent&apos;) are not found circulating in some organism  (see feedback note on this class).</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:REO_0000144>GO (Seems like this GO class should be defined structurally, rather than by its context/location in the body (i think BP agrees here, based on comments on discussion list).  Structurally, this class of immunoglobulins lacks a signal peptide that tethers it to the cell membrane.  If we use this definition, then we can say accurately that antibody reagents are of this type.)</obo:REO_0000144>

        <obo:REO_0000140>a role that inheres in an entity that is gained through a planning process upon an agent’s intent to study the entity through some assay, and realized in the execution of an assay which generates data about the entity  </obo:REO_0000140>
        <obo:REO_0000139>Evaluant vs Specimen Roles Explained: 

Both roles are ultimately realized in a process that generates information about the bearer (ie an investigation or an assay).  That is, specimens and evaluants both bear some agents intent to be studied.  The key difference is that, while an evaluant role is realized only in an assay, a specimen role is realized more broadly in an investigation (or, more precisely, a technique that is part of an investigation, since all &apos;study design execution&apos; steps are techniques).   (Recall that investigations consist of several processual parts, and that study design execution is the part where actual techniques are performed.)  So, this means that a specimen role can be realized in either an assay (like an evaluant), or in a material processing  technique that occurs during an investigation - but only one that generates another specimen (as ultimately the original specimen must bear an intent to be studied in the investigation, if only in virtue of some part of it (derived through some material processing technique) being studied).  

So, to recap: a specimen role is_realized_by some (technique and (part_of some investigation).  An evaluant role is_realized_by only assay.  Not all things that bear a specimen role will end up bearing an evaluant role (only those parts / derivations of the specimen that end up being that which data is generated about in some assay (ie those that end up also bearing an evaluant role)

Example scenario: If I collect an organism from an environment and intend to study it as an example of its type, it has a specimen role.  This  role may be realized directly in an assay about the organism, or in some material processing technique in which another specimen is generated from the original organism specimen (ie its blood is drawn form the organism as a derived/secondary specimen, intended to be studied in some assay is performed with this blood as the evaluant). 

So ultimately a specimen must itself play an evaluant role or some part of it/entity derived from it through a material processing technique must play an evaluant role

        <obo:REO_0000144>OBI (Clarify meaning of &apos;physical change&apos; in the definition of this class: As far as I can tell, &apos;physical change&apos; is considered broadly by OBI as any re-arrangement of matter in the input material, such that processes resulting in material separation, material collection, and material combination are considered material processing.

Also, it is confusing to use the term &apos;transformation&apos; in the logical definition, where referring to the description of the &apos;material transformation objective&apos; makes it clear that &apos;transformation&apos; here is not used in the same sense as in the relation of transformation (ie here it is more generally conceived to include any process with material input and material output, whereas the relation of transformation is more strictly defined to refer to a specific kind of processual change to an input material).

OBI seems to use a mixed approach - some classes are directly asserted as children of material processing, but the majority are inferred based on their achieves planned objective axiom.  </obo:REO_0000139>

    <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000456">
        <obo:REO_0000144>OBI (it is confusing to use the term &apos;transformation&apos; in this class label, as the description of this class makes it clear that &apos;transformation&apos; here is not used in the same sense as in the relation of transformation (ie here it is more generally conceived to include any process with material input and material output, whereas the relation of transformation is more strictly defined to refer to a specific kind of processual change to an input material).  Suggestion to change label of &apos;material transformation objective&apos; to &apos;material processing objective&apos;.)

Furthermore, the OBI definition of this class is very general, such that a number of &apos;objective specification&apos; subclasses that are not subsumed by this class should be (in particular, specimen creation objective) )

Finally, I have re-arranged many of the objective classes I imported form OBI below this calss - should discuss with them If my interpretations and definitions that I apply to these classes are consistent with those in OBI - if not I should not re-use these classes.</obo:REO_0000144>
        <obo:REO_0000139>Material processing is subclassed by applying three axes in the following order:
			
Axis 1  =  Process directionality/cardinality/ input-output ration (1-&gt;M vs M-&gt;1) : This distinction is based on whether input material is meant to be separated or combined.  This gives the first level children &apos;material separation objective&apos; and &apos;material combination objective&apos;.
	
Axis 2a (for &apos;material separation objective&apos;) = symmetry of the separation:  This distinction is based on whether the separation objective specifies an asymmetrical segregation of components of the input target of material separation.  If yes, it is a &apos;material component separation objective&apos;.  If not, it is a &apos;material portioning objective&apos;.
	
Axis 2b (for &apos;material combination objective&apos;), =  presence of a target input entity that is modified and whose identity is preserved:  This distinction is based on whether there is a specified target of material combination that serves as input and is modified by the addition of new material (such that its identity is preserved through this modification).  If yes, it is a &apos;material combination with target objective&apos;.  If not (ie if no single input is specified as a target that will be output in some modified form), then it is a &apos;material pooling objective&apos;.
		
Axis 3 (for &apos;material component separation objective&apos; and &apos;material combination with target objective&apos;)  = which output is the specified output, and what type of change has it undergone:  This distinction applies to processes that have more than one output. One output represents a &apos;physically modified&apos; version of some &apos;target&apos; input material (ie modified through the removal or addition of material). The other represents a &apos;contextually&apos; modified version of the material that was added or the material that was separated, according to the objective specification (this output undergoes no physical alterations to its self-contained structure or composition, but is merely re-located to some new setting or context). If the specified output to be studied/used by the investigator is of the former type, the objective is subclassed as a &apos;physical&apos; objective. If the latter, it is subclassed as a &apos;contextual&apos; objective.
	
--------------------
	
In addition, &apos;material manufacturing&apos; and &apos;material maintenance&apos; objectives represent non-disjoint siblings of the &apos;material separation&apos; and &apos;material combination&apos; objectives.</obo:REO_0000139>
        <obo:REO_0000360>material processing objective</obo:REO_0000360>
        <obo:REO_0000139>As an example of the tricky third axis of classification (physical vs contextual processing objective), consider the following two examples.
		
1. The objective of &apos;separating an appendix from an organism&apos;: This process specified by this objective has two outputs : the organism now missing its appendix, and the appendix having been removed from the organism.   If the &apos;specified output&apos; (according to the objective specification) is the organism, then we have a &apos;physical material component separation&apos; - because the specified output organism has been physically altered relative to its state as input material.  If the &apos;specified output&apos; is the appendix, then we have a &apos;contextual material component separation&apos; - because the appendix itself, as a self-contained unit, has not undergone any internal/inherent physical alterations to its structure or composition.
		
2. The objective of adding a pathogen to an organism (e.g. by injecting into blood stream): This process has a single output (the organism containing the pathogen), but two possible perspectives regarding what the &apos;specified output could be.  If the &apos;specified output&apos; is the host organism, then we have a &apos;physical material combination&apos; - because the organism has been physically altered relative to its state as input material.  If the &apos;specified output&apos; is the pathogen, then we have a &apos;contextual material combination&apos; - because the pathogen itself, as a self-contained unit, has not undergone any internal/inherent physical alterations to its structure or composition - rather only a change in its context.
		
ReO classifies material component separation and material combination objective classes in such a way as to clearly qualify as a contextual or a physical processing objective.  For example, material &apos;purification&apos;, &apos;extraction&apos;, &apos;collection&apos;, and &apos;selection&apos; objectives are all defined clearly as to indicate a contextual separation objective.  Similarly, material &apos;delivery&apos; is clearly defined to indicate a contextual combination objective.  By contrast, material &apos;removal&apos; and &apos;addition&apos; are clearly defined to indicate physical a material separation and a physical material combination, respectively.  
		
The utility of making these distinctions is that processed materials (particularly specimens) can be classified as being &apos;experimentally modified&apos; (when they are specified output of some material processing that achieves some physical processing objective), VS unmodified (when they are specified output of some material processing that achieves only contextual processing objectives).   This distinction is important for scientists searching for or applying specimens/reagents, and important for interpreting data.  The immediate use case motivating this work was to logically represent CL:&apos;experimentally modified cell&apos;.</obo:REO_0000139>

        <obo:IAO_0000112>Examples of &apos;collected specimens&apos;  include blood collected from an organism, or soil samples collected from some environment.  Specimens can also be created without physically collecting them, for example by tagging animals to track them in the wild, or by merely observing the intended specimen and noting distinguishing features that will allow subsequent identification and study. Finally, specimens can also be processed from other specimens, for example the extraction of nuclear material from a cell specimen to generate a nuclear extract specimen.</obo:IAO_0000112>
        <obo:REO_0000140>a planned process in which some material entity is identified (and typically collected and/or tagged) as an example of its kind for intended study in an investigation.</obo:REO_0000140>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>Note that, as considered in ReO, specimen creation does not require material processing of the bearer of the specimen role (as opposed to specimen collection) - and thus specimen mcreation is a child of planned process (and not a technique). This is because we believe that &apos;intent to study as an example of its kind&apos; is what is key for being a specimen - such that the specimen role can be conferred merely by identification of some entity without any material proceessing (e.g.,  identification of a merekat to be studied in the wild, simply by observation and noting distinguishing characteristics that will allow future recognition and study). Typically, however, specimen creation involves physical processing/collection of a material of interest to be studied or used in an investigation.  A specimen collection class was created to cover this most common case, and this &apos;specimen collection&apos; class is a child of both &apos;specimen creation&apos; and &apos;material processing technique -&gt; material component separation technique&apos;.</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:REO_0000144>OBI - our definition of specimen creation may conflict with OBIs (in the sense that we beleive that identificaiton with intent to study is sufficient to confer a specimen role, wheras OBI is unclear about this).  Need to resolve this issue to determine if we can re-use this class from OBI.

HOWEVER,  it may be the what we call &apos;specimens that are not collected&apos; OBI would refer to as &apos;subjects&apos; rather than specimens.  In this case, specimens are always collected, and we could rename the specimen creation calss to be &apos;specimen collection&apos;.  This would require that inanimate objects could be subjects.</obo:REO_0000144>

        <obo:IAO_0000118>material partitioning objective</obo:IAO_0000118>
        <rdfs:comment>&apos;portioning&apos; here indicates that this is NOT an objective to separate the  input asymmetrically into outputs with specified compositional differences (as compared with its parent &apos;material separation&apos;, which more generally refers to any dissociation of some input material into outputs of similar or intentionally different compositions).

This ReO definition allows for techniques such as tissue sectioning to have a material protioning objective, as the specification for this process merely aims to partition the tissue, but not to achieve any specified compositional inequality between the sections (of course there will be some compositional differences in the outputs of a sectioning process, but these are not specifically indicated in the objective specification)</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000112>the objective to obtain multiple aliquots of an enzyme preparation, or to obtain multiple sections of a cell or  tissue sample</obo:IAO_0000112>
        <obo:REO_0000360>material portioning objective</obo:REO_0000360>
        <obo:REO_0000139>Note that it is more commonly  the case that material separation objectives specify a particullar component of the target of the separation that is to be separated, based on its physical make-up. This, by definition, is not the case for &apos;material portionings&apos;.  Furthermore, the majority of material portionings (e.g. aliquoting, sectioning) are &apos;complete&apos;, in that the target of the portioning is completely portioned and thus ceases to exist. For this reasons, &apos;material portioning objective&apos; we do not consider the identitiy of and intentions for the possible specified outputs (ie target of material spearation and separated material), such that this class is not subclassed further into contextual vs physical children as is done for &apos;material component separation objective&apos;.

However, subclassing &apos;material portioning objective&apos; to reflect such a distinction could easily be implemented in a similar way as for &apos;material component separation objective&apos;, to cover cases where indiscriminate parts of an input material are removed but not to completion.  In such cases,  the target of the separation remains as output, and the separated material or the target of the separation can used in an investigation.</obo:REO_0000139>

        <rdfs:comment>The reference to &apos;component&apos; in the label of this class indicates that this is an &apos;asymmetrical&apos;/&apos;discriminating&apos; material separation into outputs of different composition.  This is contrasted with its parent &apos;material separation objective&apos;, which more generally refers to any dissociation of some input material into outputs of similar or intentionally different compositions.  This is also contrasted with its sibling &apos;material portioning objective&apos;, which refers to separations without a specific objective to discrimately segregate components of the input material between outputs.</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:REO_0000139>Specimen Creation vs Specimen Collection::
As we will model things in ReO, a specimen creation is not a material processing, as specimens can be created purely through observation and planning (for ex, identification of monkeys in a population through observation of distinguishing features) and certainly can be achieved without a collection process (tagging monkeys with a colored dart fired from a dart gun to identify/track the tagged specimen) .

Specimen collection in ReO is a type of specimen creation in which the specimen of interest is physically removed from its environment into a lab/in vitro environment for study. The specimen creation objective will thus fall outside the material processing/transformation objective branch, while the specimen collection objective class will reside within this branch (under contextual processing objective &gt; material separation objective&gt; material collection objective).

As for the related processes that achieve these objectives, specimen creation will be asserted as a planned process (and inferred to be a technique), and specimen collection asserted as a material processing technique (inferred to be a material collection process)</obo:REO_0000139>

Not all independent variables are related to some quality inhering in a mateiral entity - but when they do, this material can be said to bear an independent variable role.  

We would want to say that an independent variable role inheres in a material entity that bears a quality (is concentration a quality of the scattered molecular aggregate (using towards some solution), or the solution? . . . concentration is often the subject of indep variable specifications, so we should figure this out. . . . may need to be able to say that the bearer of the indep variable role is a part of some larger entity such as a solution in which its concentration is varied) that is described/specified by an independent variable specification.</obo:REO_0000144>

        <rdfs:comment>&apos;cell immortalization&apos; is different from &apos;cell transformation&apos; in that the former requires only that a cell is able to replicate indefinitely in culture, while the latter further requires that the cell undergoes a set of genetic modifications that confers the properties of cancer - including the ability to grow in the absence of survival factors and the ability to divide without being specifically instructed to do so from outside the cell. In experimental settings, these qualities allow transformed cells to form tumors in animal models, and to escape contact inhibition in culture and thus grow on top of each other.</rdfs:comment>

This is because:
(1) this class refers to intentionally/experimentally modified materials that gain a sequence alteration as part of some technique, and not naturally occurring material that bear mutations; (2) Not all stable genetic modifications require sequence alterations to existing genetic material - for example, transformation of a bacterial with a plasmid capbable of being replicated and inherited by progeny cells. 

Finally, it should be noted that we do not consider cases/ouputs of &apos;unsuccessful&apos; genetic modification techniques wherein the output fails to be modified (because here we define gnetically modified material as being the SPECIFIED output of a genetic modification technique, and the output that is specified is one that is genetically altered.

        <obo:REO_0000144>OBI (transfection is asserted as a child of genetic transformation in OBI.  But it includes the delivery of non-genetic material such as RNA (e.g. siRNA) to target cells/organisms.  OBI should clarify definition of transgenic technique and adjust definition and palcement of transfection accordingly)

Also, material other than nucleic acids can be delivered via transfection, including proteins.

Note that OBI&apos;s genetic transformation (technique) class is defined using the notion of genetic material (the introduction. alteration or integration of genetic material into a cell or organism).  But this concept is not defined anywhere, and is ambiguous.  Best I can find is in the ExptDesign sandbox version of OBI, where it is defined as &quot;A nucleic acid macromolecule that is part of an organism and can be replicated within it.  In this case, things like siRNA transfections, which would seem to fall under OBI:transfection, would not be considered genetic transformations by OBI&apos;s def - yet OBI:transfection is a subclass of OBI:genetic transformation</obo:REO_0000144>
        <obo:REO_0000140>a technique which relies on the use of physical, electrical, or chemical mechanisms to introduce molecular entities of biological interest into a cell</obo:REO_0000140>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>Note here that the specified input and output of a transfection is a cell (which may or may not be part of some larger material such as a cell line or orgnaism).  This is because the transfection process fundamentally refers the the act of introducing some moelcules into a cell.  A transfected cell line or organism is one which has as part trasnfected cells.</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <obo:IAO_0000116>Regarding naming conventions, we have attempted to avoid usage of ambiguous/inconsistently applied terms such as &apos;primary&apos; in crafting preferred labels for our cell culture classes, as such terms have varied meaning in different communities.  For example, &apos;primary&apos; can mean a cell culutre is &apos;unpassaged&apos; in some circles, and that it is &apos;mortal&apos; in others.  However, we have included these as alternative terms to make them available to different communities wishing to apply them as community-specific labels. For example,  &apos;primary cell culture&apos; is set as an alt term for both &apos;unpassaged cell culture&apos; and &apos;mortal cell culture&apos;.

Similarly, the term &apos;line&apos; is subject to varied initerpretation (can refer to a culture that is immortalized, or  a culture that has been passaged).  Here, we use &apos;line&apos; only in cases where the culture has been immortalized, and use &apos;culture&apos; in labels of classes that are not immortal.</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:REO_0000144>OBI (be sure that this class is intended to cover cultures of unicellualr organisms)</obo:REO_0000144>
        <obo:REO_0000139>Classification Axes for the Cell Culture Hierarchy:
     The cell culture hierarchy is classified first according to origin of the cells in culture (multicellular organism cells vs unicellular organisms), and second (for multicellular organism cultures)  based on mortality of the cells comprising the culture (this axis does not apply to unicellular organism cultures). 

Equivalent Classes:
      In addition to this primary asserted hierarhcy, several additional equivalent classes can be defined based experimental techniques used in processing/generating a cell culture (e.g. selected cell culture, passaged cell culture, genetically modified cell culutre, etc). Additional dimensions can serve as the basis for equivalent classes such as &apos;expression cell line&apos;, &apos;disease model cell line&apos;, &apos;adherent cell line&apos;.  Several examples are implemented in ReO - primarily under &apos;immortal cell line&apos; as these represent the cell culture reagents of broadest interest and utility.  However these same design patterns could be applied to create simialr defined classes at other levels in the cell culture hierarchy (e.g. cell cultures, unicellular oganism cultures, mortal cell cultures).</obo:REO_0000139>

        <rdfs:comment>Note that the term &apos;primary&apos; in &apos;primary cell culture&apos; refers to the fact that the culture has yet to be subcultured/passaged (which makes it a cell line).  In contrast, the term &apos;primary&apos; in &apos;prmary cell line&apos; indicates that the cell line is not immortal, and will senesce after a limited number of doublings.</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:REO_0000139>note that the primary axis for subclassing microarray here is based on the type of entity that is immobilized and that bears the independent variable role.  An alternate axis is used to define cellular microarray, which is distinguished based on the identity of the study subject an array is used to investigate (ie a cell) . . . as cellular microarrays can have many types of molecules immobilized on their solid substrate </obo:REO_0000139>
        <obo:REO_0000140>a material entity that is comprised of a collection of materials arrayed in two dimensions on a solid substrate (typically glass, silicon, plastic, or paraffin), that allows assay of a large number of biological specimens using high-throughput screening methods</obo:REO_0000140>

        <rdfs:comment>In ReO we view microarrays as reagents (as opposed to devices as they are viewed in OBI), because the principle components of microarrays are their molecular probes, each of which serves a reagent role in the execution of a microarray experiment. The solid  matrix/substrate serves a secondary role to support the organization and presentation of these molecular reagents in the context of an experiment. The ultimate function of the microarray as a whole, then, is realized through the manifold chemical interactions of its molecular probes, which can be conceptually reduced to the realization of reagent roles inhering in these moleuclar entities.  Thus, in ReO we consider the microarray as a reagent, rather than a device, as the realization of its function occurs at the molecular level.  </rdfs:comment>

        <obo:IAO_0000116>Establishing a cell culture could be said to achieve a manufacturing objective, as the cell culture itself is a new entity manufactured from the assembly of input cells.  This technique also qualifies as an &apos;experimental modification&apos; in the sense that the individual cells that are part of this cell culture represent physically modified versions of the input cells (ie that they have been cultured to incorporate nutrients and express surface proteins required for their survival in vitro).  This view is taken to support the convention of viewing cultured cells as &apos;experimentally modified&apos;, as established in the Cell Ontology.</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <obo:IAO_0000231>1. not clear that my interpretation of this concept is same as in this OBI class, so created own &apos;genetic modification technique&apos; class and will use this for now.  

2. Oddly, when I use the OBI class here it does not infer as a type of experimental modification, but if I duplicate the OBI class and replace all usages of the OBI class with this duplicated class (so essentially this du0plicated class is identical in axioms and usage to the OBI class) - this duplicated class now classifies correctly.  Only real difference is in some of the annotation properties ( e.g. all of them live in ReO, and the label of the duplicated class is &apos;genetic modification technique&apos;, as opposed to this being a ReO alternative label for &apos;genetic transformation&apos; - the original OBI label)


All class axioms duplicated on new ReO gneetic modification technique class</obo:IAO_0000231>
        <rdfs:comment>Note that here we do NOT include cases such as transient transfections where the added genetic material may not be capable of stable replication and propagation to progenitors.  While such process allow for expression of exogenous genes in a target cell or organism,  there is no stable, heritable changes to what we consider to be the &apos;genetic material&apos; of the target.</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:REO_0000144>OBI (re: clarification of OBI class label &apos;genetic transformation&apos; . . . note that here we do NOT include cases such as transient transfections where the added genetic material may not be capable of stable replication and propagation to progenitors.  While such process allow for expression of exogenous genes in a target cell or organism,  there is no stable, heritable changes to what we consider to be the &apos;genetic material&apos; of the target.  

This class in OBI (genetic transformation) seems like it may include such cases - if so we should not import here, as meaning is different than what we intend with &apos;genetic modification technique&apos;.  Consider making two classes in ReO: &apos;genetic modification technique&apos; being more inclusive, and including things like stable transfections (since these are material delivery and thus modifications), and then the subtype &apos;stable/heritable/integral genetic modification technique&apos; or &apos;genetic material modification technique&apos;  to be equivalent to my current meaning here - where genetic material is truly modified.</obo:REO_0000144>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>MHB:created editor preferred term &apos;genetic modification technique&apos; in oplace of the OBI label &apos;genetic transformation&apos; for two reasons: (1) used &apos;modification&apos;  to avoid confusion with &apos;cell transformation&apos; (a process through which genetic modifications confer properties of cancer upon a cell); (2) appended with &apos;technique&apos; to clarify that this is a planned process and not a naturally occuring genetic transformation/modification event.</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <obo:IAO_0000116>1. Original OBI label was &apos;recombinant vector cloning&apos;.  We created ReO alternative term &apos;recombinant construct cloning&apos; for display in ReO, for consistency with the REO construct class, and to avoid semantic ambiguity of the term &apos;vector&apos; in the biomedical domain.

2. Note that we do not consider &apos;empty&apos; DNA constructs (backbones) that carry no &apos;construct insert&apos; to be products of &apos;recombinant construct cloning&apos;, as the term &apos;cloning&apos; is typically associated with the progagation and characterization of a specific piece of DNA that is inserted into a DNA construct.

        <obo:REO_0000139>The reagent hierachy contains a core set of reagent classes pulled together from their asserted positions within the material entity hierarchy. The presentation/organization of these classes here is meant for easy and intuitive navigability, and thus presents recognizable classes of reagents as its top level children.  

As there are also several defined equivalent classes presented in this hierarchy, a given class of reagents may be found in more than one location. For example, a plasmid expressing an siRNA molecule targeted against a cellular gene product will classify as a nucleic acid reagent &gt; DNA construct &gt; siRNA construct, as well as a gene knockdown reagent&gt;RNAi reagent &gt; siRNA reagent (based on  the function of the siRNA product of this plasmid).</obo:REO_0000139>
        <obo:IAO_0000589>biomedical research reagent</obo:IAO_0000589>
        <rdfs:comment>1. Reagents are distinguished from instruments or devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily particpate in or have parts that participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during their intended participation in some technique.  By contrast, instruments do not participate in a chemical reaction/interaction during the technique.

2. Reagents are distinguished from study subjects/evaluants in that study subjects and evaluants are that about which conclusions are drawn and knowledge is sought in an investigation - while reagents, by definition, are not.  It should be noted, however, that reagent and study subject/evaluant roles can be borne by instances of the same type of material entity - but a given instance can only realize one of these roles in the execution of a given  assay. For example, taq polymerase can bear a reagent role or an evaluant role.  In a DNA sequencing assay aimed at generating sequence data about some plasmid, the reagent role of the taq polymerase is realized. In an assay to evaluate the quality of the taq polymerase itself, the evaluant/study subject role of the taq is realized, but not the reagent role since the taq is the subject about which data is generated.

3. In regard to the statement that reagents are &apos;distinct&apos; from the specified outputs of a technique:  note that a reagent may be incorporated into a material output of a technique, as long as the IDENTITY of this output is distinct from that of the bearer of the reagent role.  For example, dNTPs input into a PCR are reagents that become part of the material output of this technique, but this output has a new identity (ie that of a &apos;nucleic acid molecule&apos;) that is distinct from the identity of the dNTPs that comprise it.  Similarly, a biotin molecule input into a cell labeling technique are reagents that become part of the specified output, but the identity of the output is that of some modified cell specimen which shares identity with the input unmodified cell specimen, and not with the biotin label. Thus, we see that an important criteria of &apos;reagent-ness&apos; is that it is a facilitator, and not the primary focus of an investigation or material processing technique (ie not the specified subject/evaluant about which knowledge is sought, or the specified output material of the technique).</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000115>a material entity that bears a reagent role, such that it is intended to be applied in a scientific technique to participate in a chemical interaction facilitating the generation of knowledge about some distinct entity, or the generation of some distinct material specified output</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>At the class level, &apos;reagents&apos; are defined by bearing a &apos;reagent role&apos;.  However, the nebulous/intractable nature of when and how this role is gained for a given instance - in that it relies on knowing which instances are subject to an agents intentional designs - make specifying the extensions of &apos;reagent&apos; classes a  imprecise and impractical pursuit. This is generally true for all &apos;role-based&apos; classes such as reagents, specimens, study-subjects, etc.  

For this reason, we were forced to take a more practical (if less ontologically rigorous) approach in modeling ReO, and interpret the bearing of a reagent role loosely to apply to classes whose instances, when processed/prepared in some way, are CONVNETIONALLY are used as reagents.  

This is relatively straight-forward for materials that exist only as synthetic or manufactured products (ie are not naturally produced) - as all are created de novo according to the intent of some agent. In ReO, classes of synthetic molecules or manufactured materials that are conventionally used as reagents are given a reagent role, even if it may not be the case that every instances will be subject of some agents intent to apply it experimentally as a reagent.  Examples include Alexafluors, synthetic oligos, and recombinant plasmids, cell lines, and microarrays. 

Classes representing materials that are conventionally used as reagents but can occur naturally present a different challenge.  Examples include sodium chloride, proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), or antibiotics such as gentimycin.  Here, the &apos;universal&apos; class of all instances of such entities cannot be said to bear a reagent role because not all instances have been processed for human application (e.g. salt in the Great Salt Lake, or BSA in the blood of a grazing cow do not bear reagent roles).  In such cases, ReO imports or creates universal classes (e.g. ChEBI:sodium chloride), and subclasses these universals to describe the subset of instances that have been processed so as to be applied as reagents. This subclass is logically defined by bearing a &apos;reagent role&apos;.  For example, ReO:sodium chloride reagent = ChEBI:sodium chloride and has_role some &apos;reagent role&apos;, and the ReO:BSA reagent class bears a &apos;reagent role&apos; and represents the subset of all BSA that has been processed for potential experimental application.  In this way, reagent classes are asserted according to their &apos;natural type&apos;, and a reasoner can create a stand-alone hierarchy of all classes bearing a reagent role under the defined &apos;reagent&apos; class (= &apos;material entity&apos; and has_role some &apos;reagent role&apos;)</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <rdfs:comment>In regard to the statement that reagents are &apos;distinct&apos; from the specified outputs of a technique:  note that a reagent may be incorporated into a material output of a technique, as long as the IDENTITY of this output is distinct from that of the bearer of the reagent role.  For example, dNTPs input into a PCR are reagents that become part of the material output of this technique, but this output has a new identity (ie that of a &apos;nucleic acid molecule&apos;) that is distinct from the identity of the dNTPs that comprise it.  Similarly, a biotin molecule input into a cell labeling technique are reagents that become part of the specified output, but the identity of the output is that of some modified cell specimen which shares identity with the input unmodified cell specimen, and not with the biotin label. Thus, we see that an important criteria of &apos;reagent-ness&apos; is that it is a facilitator, and not the primary focus of an investigation or material processing technique (ie not the specified subject/evaluant about which knowledge is sought, or the specified output material of the technique).</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:IAO_0000112>An Illustrative Example of Experimental Roles (&apos;reagent role&apos;, &apos;evaluant role&apos;, &apos;analyte role&apos;, and &apos;target of material addition role&apos;) Realized in a Series of Three Sequential Techniques: 

1. A Material Processing Technique to Generatr a Labeled Antibody
In a antibody labeling technique, the fluorochrome label plays a &apos;reagent role&apos; (along with any buffers or enzymes used in the technique), and the antibody plays a &apos;target of material addition role&apos; (in a material processing technique such as antibody labeling, this role is analogous to the &apos;evaluant role&apos; in an assay).

2. An Assay to Determine Degree of Labeling
In an assay to determine the efficiency of labeling of the antibody, the labeled antibody plays an evaluant role, the fluorochrome plays an analyte role, and any buffers or enzymes used in the assay play reagent roles

3. An Assay to Detect Expression Level and Location of a Protein of Interest
In a immunocytochemistry assay applying this validated labeled antibody, the cells play an evaluant role, the endogenous protein of interest plays an analyte role, and the labeled antibody probe plays a reagent role (as do any buffers, fixatives, and detergents, etc use din the assay).

This example illustrates how a given material entity (an antibody for example) can bear and realize many different roles (an evaluant role, a reagent role, and a target or material addition role), and how these roles are realized in different processes.</obo:IAO_0000112>
        <obo:REO_0000139>At the class level, &apos;reagents&apos; are defined by bearing a &apos;reagent role&apos;.  However, the nebulous/intractable nature of when and how this role is gained for a given instance - in that it relies on knowing which instances are subject to an agents intentional designs - make specifying the extensions of &apos;reagent&apos; classes a  imprecise and impractical pursuit. This is generally true for all &apos;role-based&apos; classes such as reagents, specimens, study-subjects, etc.  

For this reason, we were forced to take a more practical (if less ontologically rigorous) approach in modeling ReO, and interpret the bearing of a reagent role loosely to apply to classes whose instances, when processed/prepared in some way, are CONVNETIONALLY are used as reagents.  

This is relatively straight-forward for materials that exist only as synthetic or manufactured products (ie are not naturally produced) - as all are created de novo according to the intent of some agent. In ReO, classes of synthetic molecules or manufactured materials that are conventionally used as reagents are given a reagent role, even if it may not be the case that every instances will be subject of some agents intent to apply it experimentally as a reagent.  Examples include Alexafluors, synthetic oligos, and recombinant plasmids, cell lines, and microarrays. 

Classes representing materials that are conventionally used as reagents but can occur naturally present a different challenge.  Examples include sodium chloride, proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), or antibiotics such as gentimycin.  Here, the &apos;universal&apos; class of all instances of such entities cannot be said to bear a reagent role because not all instances have been processed for human application (e.g. salt in the Great Salt Lake, or BSA in the blood of a grazing cow do not bear reagent roles).  In such cases, ReO imports or creates universal classes (e.g. ChEBI:sodium chloride), and subclasses these universals to describe the subset of instances that have been processed so as to be applied as reagents. This subclass is logically defined by bearing a &apos;reagent role&apos;.  For example, ReO:sodium chloride reagent = ChEBI:sodium chloride and has_role some &apos;reagent role&apos;, and the ReO:BSA reagent class bears a &apos;reagent role&apos; and represents the subset of all BSA that has been processed for potential experimental application. (NOTE that BSA also bears many other reagent roles - see editor note on this class). In this way, reagent classes are asserted according to their &apos;natural type&apos;, and a reasoner can create a stand-alone hierarchy of all classes bearing a reagent role under the defined &apos;reagent&apos; class (= &apos;material entity&apos; and has_role some &apos;reagent role&apos;)</obo:REO_0000139>
        <obo:REO_0000139>Reagents are distinguished from instruments or devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily particpate in or have parts that participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during their intended participation in some technique.  By contrast, instruments do not participate in a chemical reaction/interaction during the technique.

Reagents are distinguished from study subjects/evaluants in that study subjects and evaluants are that about which conclusions are drawn and knowledge is sought in an investigation - while reagents, by definition, are not.  It should be noted, however, that reagent and study subject/evaluant roles can be borne by instances of the same type of material entity - but a given instance can only realize one of these roles in the execution of a given  assay. For example, taq polymerase can bear a reagent role or an evaluant role.  In a DNA sequencing assay aimed at generating sequence data about some plasmid, the reagent role of the taq polymerase is realized. In an assay to evaluate the quality of the taq polymerase itself, the evaluant/study subject role of the taq is realized, but not the reagent role since the taq is the subject about which data is generated.</obo:REO_0000139>
        <obo:IAO_0000115>a role inhering in a material entity intended to be applied in a scientific technique and participate in a chemical interaction that facilitates the generation of knowledge about some entity distinct from the bearer, or the generation of some specified material output distinct from the bearer.</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <obo:REO_0000139>When we assert that some class of molecules has a more specific reagent role - for example that calcium phosphate has_role some &apos;transfection reagent role&apos; - we indicate that this class of molecules CONVENTIONALLY is used for the purpose indicated in the role - not that every instance of a calcium phosphate reagent is intended to be used this way (because there are other experimental applications for calcium phosphate as a reagent besides transfections).  This understanding may not be ideal/ontologically rigorous - but it is practical for the type of modeling we need to do.</obo:REO_0000139>

        <obo:IAO_0000116>A chemical reagent  is a molecular reagent that is not an information macromolecule (ie is not composed of repeating residues or amino acid or nucleotide or their analogs, and thus excludes protein reagents and nucleic acid reagents).  This distinction is made as such a high level to reflect the special status that nucleic acid and proteins hold in biomedical research - and the special attributes andd applications they have - owing in part to their genetic biological origin and bearing of genetic sequence information. Accordingly, these classes afforded their own high level category in the ReO reagent hierarchy.

Chemical reagents are primarily bioactive organic small molecules, but also include things like lipids and carbohydrates and inorganic salts and atomic/elemental entities.</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:REO_0000144>ERO - this class should replace the ERO chemical reagent class, however, the subclasses in ERO are defined as &apos;compounds&apos;.  Problems with this include (1) the notion of a compound has is not modeled in ChEBI or other OBO Foundry ontologies (or is it . . . i think ChEBI classes are constured to represent compunds), and this its use here hinders interoperability; (2) restricting chemical reagents to compounds means that things like molecular oxygen or P32 cannot be included - as these are not truly compounds (ie they are not composed of more than one kind of atom/element) (but at least in the case of P32 as a reagent - this never come as free-standing atoms - but rather as part of some larger molecule).

Seems like ERO should adopt the use of ChEBI:&apos;molecular entity&apos; here, as this class considers atoms, elements, molecules comprised of only one type of atom, ionic compounds and salts, and molecular complexes - which should cover all ERO&apos;s use cases.  ERO could then use a ERO-specific label to present these classes as deisred to users (if they want to continue to call these compounds)</obo:REO_0000144>

2. We have created a defined &apos;recombinant construct&apos; class to illustrate modeling of constructs that contain a cloned insert.  Note that these constructs are outputs not merely of a &apos;DNA construct engineering&apos; technique, but of a &apos;recombinant construct cloning&apos; technique.  For example,  &apos;genomic DNA construct&apos;, and the various recombiant plasmid classes, are asserted to contain such a cloned insert, and are specified as outputs of some&apos; recombiannt construct cloning&apos; technique.

3. We have also created the disjoint defined classes &apos;cloning construct&apos; and &apos;expression constirct&apos; to illustrate modeling of these key types of constructs distinguished by their capacity to express the cloned insert in some biological system.  

4. Several additional defined classes of constructs (mainly plasmids) have been implemented to illustrate the types of modeling that can be done with ReO.</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <obo:IAO_0000115 rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A (scientific) technique is a planned process with precise and focused objectives that are scientific in nature  (ie they produce scientific data or research materials to be used in a scientific investigation, according to a plan specification outlined in a protocol). </obo:IAO_0000115>
        <obo:IAO_0000119 rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_technique</obo:IAO_0000119>
        <obo:REO_0000300>In naming of technique classes, labels are appended with &apos;technique&apos; in cases where it is required to distinguish the class from other (non-technique) processes that could be described with a similar name.  For example the technique of genetic modicication is labeled as &apos;genetic modification technique&apos;, because the more general process of &apos;genetic modification&apos; can occur naturally through biological or pathological processes, or intentionally throguh a planned experimental technique.  Similarly, the technique of cell line immortalization is labeled as &apos;cell line immortalization technique&apos;, because the more general process of &apos;cell line immortalization&apos; can occur naturally/spontaneously or intentionally through a planned technique.

Note also that any material that you indicate to be output from a material processing technique will be inferred to be a research material.</obo:REO_0000300>
        <obo:REO_0000300>Convention for creating technique classes should be to record (1) objectives where applicable, (2) the specified inputs and outputs, and (3) and the specific roles the inputs bear and/or are realized in a technique.

For example, &apos;recombinant construct cloning&apos; has the following axioms:
- has_specified_input some (&apos;nucleic acid&apos;  and (&apos;has role&apos; some &apos;construct insert role&apos;))
- has_specified_input some  (&apos;DNA construct&apos;  and (&apos;has role&apos; some &apos;target of material addition role&apos;))
- has_specified_ouptut some &apos;DNA construct&apos;

And &apos;moelcular label detection assay&apos; is described as:
- realizes some (&apos;evaluant role&apos; and (&apos;inheres in&apos; some &apos;labeled material&apos;)) 
- has_specified_input some (&apos;labeled material&apos; and (&apos;has role&apos; some &apos;evaluant role&apos;)
- has_specified_output some  (&apos;measurement datum&apos;  and (&apos;is about&apos; some &apos;labeled material&apos;))

This allows for inferred classification of techniques under multiple parents.</obo:REO_0000300>
        <obo:IAO_0000118>scientific technique</obo:IAO_0000118>
        <obo:REO_0000144>OBI:
1. Note that OBI prefers to use the realizes relation to link processes to plan specifications they achieve (realizes some (concretizes some protocol)).  I dont agree here, and created the &apos;achieves_plan_specification&apos; property for this need. 

2.  Would like their opinion on this class, and the value of organizing protocol-driven techniques under planned process.  Esp in reagrd to the now obsolete OBI class &apos;protocol application&apos;, which sounds like it may have been intended to represent what ReO here calls techniques.
(OBI:0000069 &apos;protocol application&apos; = a process carried out to bring about the  objective defined in the protocol applied. Every protocol_application has one or more inputs and outputs definition_source: OBI. a protocol_application is a planned process realizes a process in which the   objective of the protocol is achieved. The manipulation of materials and information on materials as part of an investigation)

3. Also look at the former OBI:0000011 class &apos;objective-driven process&apos; = a process which is initiataed by one or more human participants with an overall objective they wish to achieve. The participantes do not necessarily have to have a plan how to achieve it. - this is wehre things like assay were once colleced, and it was a sibling of planned process . . . I (BP) felt the need for this upper class, as processes like planning or interpreting data clearly have an objective but do not have a plan. This distinction may get tricky.</obo:REO_0000144>
        <obo:IAO_0000116> &apos;Technique&apos; is not implemented as a defined class, given the subtle and subjective nature of its defining distinctions (however, we could define it as &apos;a planned process that realizes / achieves_plan_specification some protocol&apos;). For now, any planned processes qualifying as scientific techniques will be asserted here as either assays or material porcessing techniques or data processing techniques.

Techniques in scope here should be those related to reagents (ie material processing techniques used to generate a reagent or techniques/assays in which reagents are used).  These classes are referenced as such in logical definitions of reagent classes.</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <rdfs:comment>Scientific techniques are distinguished from planned processes in that:
 
(1) they have objectives that are &apos;scientific&apos; in nature (admittedly a rather vague requirement)

(2) they are focused/limited in scope, such that they are amenable to capturing in a &apos;protocol&apos; plan specification (as opposed to a broader &apos;plan specifications&apos; such as a &apos;grant&apos; or &apos;study design&apos;, which may incorporate many techniques).

(3) they are performed by some human agent (as opposed to a computer or software agent), such that computational data transformations and statistical analyses do not qualify as techniques (these planned processes would be described by &apos;plan specifications&apos; such as an &apos;algorithm&apos; or &apos;software&apos;, not a &apos;protocol&apos;).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A molecular tracker typically acts as an intermediary between an analyte (or label associated with an analyte) and a reporter, by either (1) having as part some reporter that was covalently attached prior to applicaiton of the label, or (2) having as part some moiety that specifically interacts with a reporter.  Examples of (1) include probe-reporter conjugates such as a P33 labeled oligonucleotide probe, or a fluorochrome-conjugated antibody.  Examples of (2) include biotin incorporated into a oligonucleotide probe that recruits a fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin molecule, or a primary antibody that recruits a labeled secondary antibody in a western blot.</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000112>Case 1: Nucleotides synthesized with the incorporation of biotin were used to synthesize a cDNA probe, which was then detected by adding fluorochrome-conjugated anti-biotin antibody.  Here, biotin bears a tracker role, the fluorochrome bears a reporter role, and the antibody bears a probe role.

Case 2 : An oligonucleotide synthesized with radioactive P33 and used to detect the presence of complementary sequence on a southern blot. Here, P33 bears a reporter role, and the oligo bears a probe role.

Case 3: a protein labeling assay involving the detection of S35-labeled methionine incorporated into newly synthesized proteins in a cell culture cells.  Here, S35 bears a reporter role, and there is no probe role realized.

Case 4: Covalent attachment of an fluorochrome into a primary antibody to detect a specific cellular protein in an immunocytochemistry assay. Here, the fluorochrome bears a reporter role, and the antibody bears the probe role.

Case 5: Immunosytochemical detection of a FLAG epitope tag in an overexpressed protein in cell culture cells, using a fluorochrome conjugated anti-FLAG antibody.  Here, as in Case 4,  the fluorochrome bears a reporter role and the antibody bears the probe role. In addition, the FLAG tag also bears a tracker role.

Case 6: Phalloidin molecules (a fungal toxin that binds F-actin) are conjugated to rhodamine fluorochrome and applied to a slide of fixed cells to detect actin fibers by fluorescent microscopy.

We intend for this to excludes tumor-derived cell lines such as HeLa cells, which contain a host of uncharacterized genomic mutations that resulted in transformation to a cancer phenotype.  However, we are not sure yet how to formally model  this requirement that &apos;mutant cell lines&apos; are only those that carry specific, characterized mutations - and thus rely on an objective created to define this class.</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <rdfs:comment>&apos;cell immortalization&apos; is different from &apos;cell transformation&apos; in that the former requires only that a cell is able to replicate indefinitely in culture, while the latter further requires that the cell undergoes a set of genetic modifications that confers the properties of cancer - including the ability to grow in the absence of survival factors and the ability to divide without being specifically instructed to do so from outside the cell. In experimental settings, these qualities allow transformed cells to form tumors in animal models, and to escape contact inhibition in culture and thus grow on top of each other.</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:REO_0000139>here we have modeled all cell culture cells such that they are NOT considered &apos;cells ex vivo&apos;, as we consider &apos;ex vivo&apos; to mean that a cell (or other anatomical entity) was once a part of an organism (as opposed to the looser requirement that it is not currently part of an organism).  Cell culture cells are derived from cells in vivo, but themselves, in most cases, were never actually a part of an organism (a notable exception would be in a primary cell culture immediately after its creation, before cells have doubled and derived into new cells, or a culture of cells that never divide but are maintained in culture for a period of time before they scenesce)

esp strange is that if I assert this as a type of cell, it infers as a type of cell in vitro and as a type of experimetnally modified cell, but not as a type of experimentally modified cell in vitro!!</obo:REO_0000139>

        <obo:IAO_0000116>Class restrictions here need work.  I don&apos;t think OWL is expressive enough to assert that the output cell culture container from this process contains a proper_part_of the cell culture that was input to the process.</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:IAO_0000115>a technique that takes a cell culture as input and removes some subset of cell culture cells (either through some non-selective splitting, or some cell selection process), and outputs one or more cell culture containers containing  this subset of input cell culture cells.</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <obo:REO_0000139>Here, we define subculturing as any technique that results in the growth of a proper subset of cells from some input cell culture container (dish/flask) in an output cell culture container.  Most often, subculturing involves cell culture splitting, whereby a non-slective process separates out some subset of cells into a new cell culture container. However, subculturing can also be achieved through a selection process, where a specified subset of cells from the input culture are killed or removed, leaving some desired subset for continued culturing.  

Note that the definition intentionally references the container in which passaged cells are grown, stating that subculturing results in a proper subset of the input cells is contained in an output cell culture container. This is because cell culture splitting can involve re-culturing of ALL input cells, split between several new containers. For example, a 1:5 spllit of an input container of cells into 5 new dishes.  Here, at the level of the cells, the output is NOT a proper subset of the input (becasue all input cells remain in the output culture).  Rather, at the level of an cell culture container, there is some container that contains a proper subset of the input cells.</obo:REO_0000139>

        <rdfs:comment>is a narrower kind of genetic modification technique, in that it covers only stable addition of exogenous genetic material, and not any mutation or deletion of existing genetic material.

Genetic material here is considered to be any nucleic acid that is capable of being replicated and inherited by offspring cells or viorions. Thus, things like transient DNA transfections where no stable change is made to the heritable gentic content of the target cell, or morpholino or siRNA transfections that impact post-transcriptional gene expression, do not qualify.</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:REO_0000300>Convention for creating &apos;material processing technique&apos; classes should be to record objectives, and the specified inputs and outputs and the specific roles they realize in such techniques.  For example, &apos;recombinant construct cloning&apos; is described as:

has_specified_input some 
    (&apos;nucleic acid&apos;
     and (&apos;has role&apos; some &apos;construct insert role&apos;))

has_specified_input some 
    (&apos;DNA construct&apos;
     and (&apos;has role&apos; some &apos;target of material addition role&apos;))

has_specified_ouptut some &apos;DNA construct&apos;

This allows for inferred classification of techniques under multiple parents.</obo:REO_0000300>
        <obo:REO_0000300>(Ultimately, clean this annotation up and split  into ReO modeling approach and ReO development convention annotations and ReO developer note) 

Modeling Approach:
THE ALTERNATE APPROACH I WILL TRY HERE is to assert material processing techniques under material processing technique, and say that a material processing technique has output only some research material.  Then I could say that a research material is anything that has a research material role or is output of a material processing technique (actually, dont even need to put this last part in the log def of research material becaseu of the fact that mat proc techniques have output ONLY research material).  

Development convention: As a result, i would not have to worry about developers having to indicate axiomatically that material processings with an output that is a research material &apos;has_specified_output some (has_role some &apos;research material role&apos;))&apos;  (and I could remove all such existing axioms) . . . which seems more convenient.  The burden then is on developers to be sure to assert material processings that have research material outputs as material processing techniques (which should be easy, as nearly all material processings in OBi and ReO are techniques.  

Modeling Approach:
With this new approach, things will be inferred to be a research material based on their being output from a material processing technique, instead of the reverse (things being inferred to be techniques based on their having a outputs that have a research material role).  I think this is more useful and intuitive to expect developers to model and users to understand.  
Development Convention:
So be sure that all outputs of processes asserted to be &apos;materail processing techniques&apos; are indeed &apos;research materials&apos; . . . and no need to have axiom saying that output has a research amterial role, because this will be inferred from fact that material processing techniques have ouput only research material.

Developer Note:
What implicaitons would this new approach have if I decide to elim the material processing technique class and just use OBI material processing . . . then I would have a situation where a research material is defined as being output of a material processing - which is not correct.  So be aware of the issues this could cause.

ALSO, DO I NEED TO SAY HAS OUTPUT SOME RESEARCH MATERIAL AND ONLY RESEARCH MATERIAL - OR IS THE AXIOM WITH &apos;ONLY&apos; SUFFICEINT?</obo:REO_0000300>
        <obo:REO_0000139>This class is used to subsume all techniques that generate or prepare materials for potential use in an investigation (ie via synthesis, collection, purification, etc).  Investigations here are considered broadly to include any planned processes aimed at producing information of a scientific nature, including activities as simple as collecting and storing a specimen for visual observation, where the visual observation is a type of scientific analysis where data about the physical properties of the specimen are gathered and analyzed.</obo:REO_0000139>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>a material processing in which specified physical changes are made to some material input to generate a material output that has a research material role. </obo:IAO_0000115>
        <rdfs:comment>In this definition, &apos;physical change&apos; is considered broadly as any re-arrangement of matter in the input material, such that techniques resulting in material separation, material collection, and material combination are considered material processing. </rdfs:comment>
        <obo:REO_0000300>Developers should ASSERT all material processings that have as specified output only some research material  to be materail processing techniques.  Also note that any material indicated to be output from a material processing technique will be inferred to be a research material</obo:REO_0000300>
        <rdfs:comment>MHB: in logically defining material processing technique, a requirement for having specified input some material entity was omitted, because this should be true of any process that has_specified_output some material entity (matter cannot be created from nothing)</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>Convention for creating &apos;material processing technique&apos; classes should be to record objectives, and the specified inputs and outputs and the specific roles they realize in such techniques.  For example, &apos;recombinant construct cloning&apos; is described as:

has_specified_input some 
    (&apos;nucleic acid&apos;
     and (&apos;has role&apos; some &apos;construct insert role&apos;))

has_specified_input some 
    (&apos;DNA construct&apos;
     and (&apos;has role&apos; some &apos;target of material addition role&apos;))

has_specified_ouptut some &apos;DNA construct&apos;

This allows for inferred classification of techniques under multiple parents.</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>a sequence alteration that is part of a genome that is encoded in the material genome of some cell or virion</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>1. Note here that, unlike for &apos;genome&apos; and &apos;genomic sequence feature&apos;, here it is necessary for a genomic sequence alteration to be encoded in some &apos;genetic material&apos; that is part of some &apos;material genome&apos; and physcally part of some cell or virion (as we consdier this context to be important).  As a result, an alteration in the insert of some genomic DNA construct would qualify as a sequence alteration but not a genomic sequence alteration (it makes no ssnese here to consider such an insert to be &apos;transgenic&apos;, for example, without any organism context).  We will, however, continue to evaluate use cases as they emerge in regard to this decision.

2. Note that in ReO we consider epi-chromosomal genomic sequence to represent a type of genomic sequence alteration, in the sense that it alters the total sequence content of a genome.  Epi-chromosomal genomic sequence is nucleic acid sequence that is encoded by some epi-chromosomal element such as a replicative plasmid or transposon, that becomes part of the genome of some cell.

3.  Note that this does not classify as a type of &apos;genomic sequence region&apos; because deletions are a type of sequene alteration and they have an extent of zero, and thus do not qualify as regions</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <obo:REO_0000144>OBI:
(1) OBI currently does not implement anything but thelabel role (and detector but this is clearly borkena nd not being used) - but their notes indicate how they might implement related roles such as detector and reporter: &apos;Nucleotides synthesized with the incorporation of biotin were used to synthesize cDNA, which was then detected by adding fluorochrome-conjugated anti-biotin antibody.  the fluorochrome bears label role, the antibody bears detector role, the biotin bears reporter role. may need to change the terms following discussion&apos;.   ReO uses different terms for these concepts (would say that the the fluorochrome bears a covalent reporter role, the antibody a targeted reporter role, and the biotin a covalent tracker role)- need to clarify and rectify with OBI.

(2) OBI wants to use &apos;molecular tracer role&apos; instead of &apos;molecular label role&apos;  - but ReO no approve because &apos;tracer&apos; does not suggest a molecular bond is formed that associates a label with an analyte, which is at the heart of the labeling process.  &apos;tracer;&apos; merely implies that the bearer is physically co-located with an analyte or evaluant (ie a barium tracer in stool, or dye tracer in the blood))</obo:REO_0000144>
        <rdfs:comment>Note that in some cases the molecular target of the label is the analyte itself (e.g. a radiolabeld oligo probe that binds a target gene in a FISH assay), but in other cases (e.g. secondary antibodies in a ICC assay), the molecular target is another label)</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:REO_0000139>Molecular label role has four asserted subclass leaf nodes, distinguished along two axes.  The first here is their ability to emit or produce some detectable signal - &apos;reporter&apos; if capable, &apos;tracker&apos; if not. The second is the nature of their association with a molecular target - &apos;covalent&apos; vs. &apos;targeted&apos; (non-covalent).  

1. &apos;covalent reporter role&apos;, inhereing in a &apos;covalent reporter&apos; that  emits some detectable signal and is incorporated covalently into an analyte of interest or some other label that can target such an analyte.  Examples include a radioactive dATP[P33] (that can be incorporated into an oligonucleotide probe), or a Cy5 fluorochrome (that can be covalently linked to an antibody probe), or a GFP tag (that must be covalently linked to a recombinant protein of interest), or radioactive methionine[S35] (that can be covalently incorporated into proteins of interest)

2. a &apos;covalent tracker role&apos;, inhereing in a &apos;covalent tracker&apos; that must be covalently bound or incorporated into analyte or probe, and does not emit a detectable signal.  Examples include biotin incorporated into a oligonucleotide probe, or a FLAG epitope tag incorporated into a recombinant protein.

3. a &apos;targeted reporter role&apos;, inhereing in a &apos;targeted reporter&apos; that non-covalently binds to an analyte and emits a detectable signal.  Examples include toluidine blue (a blue stain that that targets heparin to detect mast cells in histochemistry), DAPI stain (binds to DNA and fluoresces under UV light), and Ponceau S stain (a red stain which binds generally to protein).  Examples also include oligonucleotides or antibodies that have been conjugated with some detectable label (e.g. [P33]-labeled oligos, cy5-conjugated antibodies)

4. a &apos;targeted tracker role&apos;, inhereing in a &apos;targeted tracker&apos; that non-covalently binds a molecular target but itself does not produce a detectable signal.  Examples include a biotin-labeled oligonucleotide probe used to associate with chromosomes in a FISH assay, an antibody used to target a specific protein in a immunhohistochemical assay.</obo:REO_0000139>
        <obo:IAO_0000112>Case 1: Nucleotides synthesized to contain a biotin moiety were used to synthesize a cDNA probe, which was then detected by adding fluorochrome-conjugated anti-biotin antibody.  Here, biotin bears a covalent tracker role, the biotin-conjugated probe bears a targeted tracker role, and the fluorochrome-conjugated antibody bears a targeted reporter role.

Case 2 : An oligonucleotide synthesized with radioactive P33 and used to detect the presence of complementary sequence on a southern blot. Here, P33 bears a covalent reporter role, and the P33-containing oligo bears a targeted reporter role.

Case 3: a protein labeling assay involving the detection of S35-labeled methionine incorporated into newly synthesized proteins in a cell culture cells.  Here, S35 bears a covalent reporter role (the label is incorporated directly into the analyte in this example, so no additional label is needed)

Case 4: An immunocytochemistry assay where a fluorochrome-labeled primary antibody is used to detect a specific cellular protein on a fixed slide. Here, the fluorochrome alone bears a covalent reporter role, the antibody alone bears a targeted tracker role, and the fluorochrome-antibody conjugate bears a targeted reporter role.

Case 5: Immunocytochemical detection of a FLAG epitope tag in an overexpressed protein in cell culture cells, using a fluorochrome conjugated anti-FLAG antibody.  Here, as in Case 4,  the fluorochrome alone bears a covalent reporter role, the antibody alone bears a targeted tracker role, and the fluorochrome-antibody conjugate bears a targeted reporter role. In addition, the FLAG tag also bears a covalent tracker role.

Case 6: Phalloidin molecules (a fungal toxin that binds F-actin) are conjugated to rhodamine fluorochrome and applied to a slide of fixed cells to detect actin fibers by fluorescent microscopy.  Here, phalloidin bears a targeted tracker role, the rhodamine bears a covalent reporter role, and the rhodamine-phalloidin conjugate bears a targeted reporter role.</obo:IAO_0000112>

        <rdfs:comment>This association of a molecule with its target is typically through a non-covalent targeted binding. However in some cases such as that of a covalent molecular label, the association is mediated through creation of a direct covalent bond (e.g. incorporation of P33 into an oligonucleotide probe, or conjugation of Cy3 to a secondary antibody)</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>the bearer will not always directly be an analyte (e.g. in the case where a molecular label targets some other molecular label - such as a secondary antibody binding a primary antibody in a immunocytochemistry assay).

        <obo:IAO_0000115>a molecular reporter role inhering in a molecular entity that is capable of producing a detectable signal, but not capable of autonomous non-covalent association with a molecular target (such that it must be covalenly attached to an analyte of interest, or to a targeted molecular label that can direct it to an analyte).</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <rdfs:comment>Reporters must be covalently attached to their target (analyte or probe), as they contain no inherent structural element that specifically binds a target.  The molecular reporter role inheres only in the part of a molecule that emits a detectable signal (ie the fluorochrome on part of a conjugated antibody, or the radioactive atoms of a labeled oligonucleotide probe, or the GFP moiety in a GFP-fusion protein).</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000112>Case 1: Nucleotides synthesized with the incorporation of biotin were used to synthesize a cDNA probe, which was then detected by adding fluorochrome-conjugated anti-biotin antibody.  Here, biotin bears a tracker role, the fluorochrome bears a reporter role, and the antibody bears a probe role.

Case 2 : An oligonucleotide synthesized with radioactive P33 and used to detect the presence of complementary sequence on a southern blot. Here, P33 bears a reporter role, and the oligo bears a probe role.

Case 3: a protein labeling assay involving the detection of S35-labeled methionine incorporated into newly synthesized proteins in a cell culture cells.  Here, S35 bears a reporter role, and there is no probe role realized.

Case 4: Covalent attachment of an fluorochrome into a primary antibody to detect a specific cellular protein in an immunocytochemistry assay. Here, the fluorochrome bears a reporter role, and the antibody bears the probe role.

Case 5: Immunosytochemical detection of a FLAG epitope tag in an overexpressed protein in cell culture cells, using a fluorochrome conjugated anti-FLAG antibody.  Here, as in Case 4,  the fluorochrome bears a reporter role and the antibody bears the probe role. In addition, the FLAG tag also bears a tracker role.

Case 6: Phalloidin molecules (a fungal toxin that binds F-actin) are conjugated to rhodamine fluorochrome and applied to a slide of fixed cells to detect actin fibers by fluorescent microscopy.  Here, phalloidin bears a probe role (it binds non-covalently to actin), and rhodamine bears a reporter role.</obo:IAO_0000112>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>a set of planned processes that has the objective to generate data about some material entity in order to test or generate one or more hypotheses. An experiment consists of planning, execution of one or more assays, data analysis, and drawing conclusions.

        <obo:REO_0000139>APPROACH #1:  Clarificaiton of the distinctions between investigation, experiment, and assay :

Investigation vs Experiment:
An investigation consists necessarily of planning (in which objectives are set), execution (in which assays and techniques are performed), documentation (in which process and results are recorded) and analysis (in which data is interpreted). Like an investigation, an experiment consists of planning, execution, documentation, and analysis.  Furthermore, investigations or experiments can aim to generate hypotheses in addition to testing them.

However, ther are two key distinctions we would like to make in modeling investigations vs experiments: 

(1) unlike investigations, the execution phase of an experiment does not include material processing or preparation techniques - only assays that generate data. So, a given experiment may be equivalent to an investigation when its execution consists only of an assay or set of assays. 

(2) the objectives of an experiment are more limited in scope, aiming to generated data about some INSTANCE of an evaluant and thereby test some hypothesis. By contrast, the objectives of investigations can reach farther to seek knowledge about CLASSES of natural materials and phenomenon even when INSTANCES of these classes are not directly used in the execution of an investigation (ie when cancer cell lines are used as &apos;proxies&apos; for seeking knowledge about a particular class of tumor).  

Experiment vs Assay:
Unlike an investigation or experiment, an assay consists only of an execution stage.  An assay is a self-contained planned process, which does not include related planning or analysis processes.  So, while a given experiment may consist of only a single assay, the experment also comprehends planning and analysis processes. </obo:REO_0000139>

So, in justifying that a cell line is a reagent, we can it is permissible for reagents to bear an evaluant role in an assay ONLY as a &apos;proxy specimen&apos; about which DATA is generated, but it is not true that a reagent can be an instance of the class specified as the thing  about which knowledege is sought/conclusoins are made (recall, drawing a conclusion is a part of an investigation, but not an assay).</obo:REO_0000139>

Case 2 : An oligonucleotide synthesized with radioactive P33 and used to detect the presence of complementary sequence on a southern blot. Here, P33 bears a reporter role, and the oligo bears a probe role.

Case 3: a protein labeling assay involving the detection of S35-labeled methionine incorporated into newly synthesized proteins in a cell culture cells.  Here, S35 bears a reporter role, and there is no probe role realized.

Case 4: Covalent attachment of an fluorochrome into a primary antibody to detect a specific cellular protein in an immunocytochemistry assay. Here, the fluorochrome bears a reporter role, and the antibody bears the probe role.

In a buffered reaction that is part of some technique to generate a macromolecular output, any buffers or other chemicals that may exhange atoms or ions with participants make only minor contributions at the atomic level of composition.  The output cannot be said to derive from these buffers/chemicals, which therefore play non-incorporant roles. For example, In a material labeling technique where a small molecule fluorochrome is conjugated to an antibody, the incorporants include an antibody and a fluorochrome.  However any buffers or other chemicals that may exhange atoms, ions, or small molecular moieties with the antibody or fluorochrome and thereby contribute minimally to the composition of the specified output, at an atomic level of granularity, play only a non-incorporant roles.

        <obo:IAO_0000112>Two material labeling techniques are described below to illustrate the use of incorporant role and its subtypes:

Example 1:
In a material labeling technique where a small molecule fluorochrome is conjugated to an antibody, the incorporants include an antibody and a fluorochrome.  A primary incorporant role is realized by the antibody, and a secondary incorporant role is realized by the fluorochrome, because the specified output is an &apos;antibody&apos; which is labeled by a fluorochrome.  Both the antibody and fluorochrome realize significant incorporant roles.  However any buffers or other chemicals that may exhange atoms, ions, or small molecular moieties with the antibody or fluorochrome and thereby contribute minimally to the composition of the specified output do not play significant incorporant roles (and may play non- incorporant roles?). Furthermore, the antibody realizes a major incorporant role, and the fluorochrome realizes a minor incorporant role, as the antibody contributes a significantly greater proportion of the material in the specified output compared to the fluorochrome

Example 2 : 
In a material labeleing technique where a large GFP protein is attached to a small 10-amino acid peptide representing a protein degradation signal (a &apos;degron&apos;), the incorporants include the GFP protein and the degron. A primary incorporant role is realized by the degron, and a secondary incorporant role is realized by the GFP protein, because the specified output is a &apos;degron&apos; that i is labeled by GFP.  Both the GFP protein and the degron play significant incorporant roles.  However any buffers or other chemicals that may exhange atoms, ions, or small molecular moieties with incorporants and thereby contribute minimally to the composition of the specified output do not play significant incorporant roles (and may play non-incorporant roles). Here, the degron realizes the minor incorporant role and the GFP protein realizes the major incorporant role, as the GFP contributes a significantly greater proportion of material in the specified output compared to the degron.</obo:IAO_0000112>

        <rdfs:comment>Alt def: an assay which detects a signal produced by a molecular label that is associated with some target analyte, where the molecular label serves as a proxy for the presence, abundance, or location of the analyte. The detected (signal-producing) label may associate with the this analyte directly (e.g  a molecular stain incorporated directly into an analyte), or indirectly (e.g. a molecular reporter  which associates through a molecular probe or tracker that binds the analyte directly).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Note that we call this a &apos;chemical&apos; or &apos;molecular&apos; interaction because it occurs between molecular entities or groups at a chemical level (ie exploiting only the &apos;chemical&apos; properties of the interactors, and not emergent &apos;physical&apos; properties that result from some structured or coordinated organization of these molecules in space).  Even in the cases where compounds or solutions are mixed to promote an interaction, the interaction occurs fundamentally at a chemical level and depends only on the chemical properties of the molecular entities that comprise the interactors.</rdfs:comment>

Note also that in ReO we view the term &apos;culture&apos; as more general than &apos;line&apos;, where culture covers all types of cultures (mortal and immortal), while ‘line’ is used in labels only for cell cultures that are immortalized.  This is because, as with the term ‘primary’, there is varied use of the term ‘line’.  To some it means ‘any cell culture that has been passaged’, and to others it means ‘any cell culture that can be propagated long term (ie immortalized)’.  So, while there may be disagreement that a passaged but mortal culture is a cell line, all would agree that an immortalized culture is a cell line.  Thus our use of the labels ‘mortal cell culture cell’ and ‘immortal cell line cell’.</obo:REO_0000139>

        <obo:IAO_0000112>The following use cases illustrate how the four primary subtypes of molecular reporter ( targeted tracker, targeted reporter, covalent tracker, and covalent reporter) apply.

Case 1: Nucleotides synthesized to contain a biotin moiety were used to synthesize a cDNA probe, which was then detected by adding fluorochrome-conjugated anti-biotin antibody.  Here, biotin is a covalent tracker, the biotin-labeld probe is a targeted tracker (targets some nucelic acid that is the analyte of interest), and the fluorochrome-conjugated antibody is a targeted reporter (it targets the biotin-labled probe).

Case 2 : An oligonucleotide synthesized with radioactive dATP[P33] and used to detect the presence of complementary sequence on a southern blot. Here, dATP[P33] is a covalent reporter, and the P33-containing oligo is a targeted reporter.

Case 3: a protein labeling assay involving the detection of S35-labeled methionine incorporated into newly synthesized proteins in a cell culture cells.  Here, Methionine[S35] is a covalent reporter.  The label is incorporated directly into the analyte in this example, so no additional label is needed.

Case 4: An immunocytochemistry assay where a fluorochrome-labeled primary antibody is used to detect a specific cellular protein on a fixed slide. Here, the fluorochrome alone is a covalent reporter, the antibody alone is a targeted tracker, and the fluorochrome-antibody conjugate is a targeted reporter.

Case 5: Immunocytochemical detection of a FLAG epitope tag in an overexpressed protein in cell culture cells, using a fluorochrome conjugated anti-FLAG antibody.  Here, as in Case 4,  the fluorochrome alone is a covalent reporter, the antibody alone is a targeted tracker, and the fluorochrome-antibody conjugate is a targeted reporter. In addition, the FLAG tag is a covalent tracker.

Case 6: Phalloidin molecules (a fungal toxin that binds F-actin) are conjugated to rhodamine fluorochrome and applied to a slide of fixed cells to detect actin fibers by fluorescent microscopy.  Here, phalloidin is a targeted tracker, the rhodamine is a covalent reporter, and the rhodamine-phalloidin conjugate is a targeted reporter.</obo:IAO_0000112>
        <obo:REO_0000139>Axes of Classification:
The top level primary/asserted axis for molecular label classification distinguishes &apos;reporters&apos; from &apos;trackers&apos;, based on the &apos;detectablility&apos; of the molecular entity bearing the molecular label role.

At the next level in the hierarchy, a distinciton is made between &apos;covalent&apos; and &apos;targeted&apos; labels, based on the mechanism of binding that the label uses in associating with its intended target.

Logical Definitions:
Pursued this approach for logical defs of molecular label subclasses using molecular label subroles (rather than dispositions) because:
(1) according to our interpretation of a BFO:role, we believe it to be ontologically correct to create and apply these roles in this way, as the application of molecular entities as reporters or trackers reflects a role they bear and not some more fundamental disposition or quality shared by all members of a molecular label subclass; (2) practically speaking, the use of dispositions can lead to complex axiomatization and high burden for getting classes/instances to qualify for subsumption as labels, and (3) the assignment of such molecular dispositions may be out of scope for ReO/OBI.

Rather, we used molecular label role subtypes, and &apos;hid&apos; dispositions required for these roles in the definition of the role.  However, because bearing such dispositions is not always neccessary and sufficient to &apos;define&apos; a subclass of molecular lables, we use the roles for defining our molecular label equivalent classes. </obo:REO_0000139>

        <obo:REO_0000139>Specimen Creation vs Specimen Collection::
As we will model things in ReO, a specimen creation is not a material processing, as specimens can be created purely through observation  (for ex, identification of monkeys in a population through observation of distinguishing features) and certainly can be achieved without a collection process (tagging monkeys with a colored dart fired from a dart gun to identify/track the tagged specimen) .

Specimen collection is a type of specimen creation in which the specimen of interest is physically removed from its environment into a lab environment for study. The specimen creation objective will thus fall outside the material processing/transformation objective branch, while the specimen collection objective class will reside within this branch, under contextual processing objective &gt; material separation objective&gt; material collection objective.

As for the related processes that achieve these objectives, specimen creation will be a planned process (and inferred to be a technique), and specimen collection a material collection process (inferred to be a material processing technique)</obo:REO_0000139>

        <rdfs:comment>Relation to Specimen Creation : Specimen creation typically (but not always) involves physical collection of a material of interest to be studied or used in an investigation.  A specimen collection class was created to cover the typical case, which is subsumed by the specimen creation class that should be used when the specimen role is gained without physical collection of the material entiy(ies) of interest.

Examples of &apos;collected specimens&apos;  include blood collected from an organism, or soil samples collected from some environment.  Specimens can also be created without collection, for example by tagging animals to track them in the wild, o rmy merely observing the intended specimen and noting distinguishing features that will allow subsequent identification and study. Finally, specimens can also be processed from other specimens, for example the extraction of nuclear material from a cell specimen to generate a nuclear extract specimen.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A reagent is a material entity bearing a reagent role that is : 

(1) GAINED by virtue of its bearer being intended as input into either (a) an assay, where it contributes to the detection, measurement, or examination of some other substance or process, or (b) a material processing technique aimed at producing materials to be used in such an assay

(2) REALIZABLE only through its bearer participating in (or having parts that participate in) some chemical reaction during the execution of some assay or material processing technique, such that(a) in the case of an assay, data is not generated about the bearer, and (b) in the case of a material processing technique, the bearer does not contribute significant material to the specified output material.

Reagents are therefore distinguished from instruments or devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents necessarily are chemically altered or consumed (or have parts that are) when they participate in some technique.  By contrast, instruments are not consumed or have parts that are chemically altered or consumed in a chemical reaction during the technique.

Reagents are distinguished from evaluants only in the sense that, while a type of material entity can bear both of these roles, a given instance of the material cannot realize both in the same process. For example, taq polymerase can bear both a reagent and evaluant role.  In a DNA sequencing assay aimed at generating sequence data about some plasmid, the reagent role of the taq polymerase is realized. In an assay to evaluate the quality of the taq polymerase itself, the evaluant role of the taq is realized, but not the reagent role since the taq is the subject about which data is generated.</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:IAO_0000112>As input into an assay, a reagent is not that which data is generated about, but rather facilitates the generation of data about an evaluant. For example, in a DNA sequenceing assay, buffers, labeled nucleotides, and polymerase enzyme are reagents, and the input template DNA to be sequenced is the evaluant.
	
As input into a material processing technique, a reagent does not contribute significant material to the specified output object, but rather facilitates the creation or modification of the input material that does contribute matter to this output object.  For example, in a PCR reaction to amplify a DNA insert for subcloning, the buffer and polymerase enzyme serve as reagents, while the  template and nucleotides that are incorporated into the output material do not play a reagent role.

These two examples illustrate how the same type of material (e.g nucelotides) can serve as reagents in one context (a sequenceing assay) but not in another (a PCR reaction to generate subcloning intermediates). Similarly, different instances of the same class of material entity can bear a reagent or an evaluant role that are realized in different processes. For example, taq polymerase can play a reagent role in a PCR technique, but studied as an evaluant in a biochemical structure-function assay.  Thus, in the context of a given assay or technique, an instance of a material entity is EITHER a reagent OR and evaluant, but not both.</obo:IAO_0000112>
        <obo:REO_0000139>The reagent hierachy contains a core, disjoint set of reagent classes that includes &apos;antibody reagent&apos;, &apos;chemical reagent&apos;, &apos;cell line&apos;, &apos;nucleic acid reagent&apos;, &apos;protein reagent&apos;, and &apos;reagent library&apos;.  Each instance of a reagent or reagent class will fall under only one of these core categories.  In addition, several equivalent classes of reagents are defined (e.g. molecular label, moleculr probe, gene knockdown reagent), based on logically defined attributes exhibited by reagents exhibit (e.g. roles, functions, processes participating in, etc).  In addition to in addition to classifying under one of the core reagent classes listed above, a given reagents or reagent class might also classify as one or more of these equivalent classes (as inferred by the reasoner).  For example, a plasmid expressing an siRNA molecule targeted against a cellular gene product will classify as a nucleic acid reagent &gt; DNA construct &gt; siRNA construct, as well as a gene knockdown reagent (based on  the function of the siRNA product of this plasmid)</obo:REO_0000139>

        <rdfs:comment>BP exmaple : even in the same exact process (addition of a fluorescent labeled antibody to an ELISA plate to measure binding to some fixed protein), the identity of the evaluant and the reagent(s) are in the eye of the experimentalist.  For instance, if the goal of the assay is to confirm that the antibody probe works by comparing binding to positive and negative control proteins on the ELISA, then it is the evaluant and the proteins on the ELISA plate are the reagents.  If the goal of the assay is to identify a protein target from some panel of samples using a known/validated fluorochrome-linked antibody probe, then the antibody probe and fluorocrome are reagents, and the protein samples on the ELISA plate are the evaluants.</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000112>Explanation of Roles Realized Through Three Squential Techniques:

1. A Material Processing Technique (Generation of a Labeled Antibody)
In a antibody labeling technique, the antibody and fluorochrome play incorporant roles (primary and secondary incorporant roles, respectively), and any coupling or elution buffers used play reagent roles.

2. An Assay (Determining Degree of Labeling)
In an assay to determine the efficiency of labeling of the antibody, the labeled antibody plays an evaluant role, the fluorochrome plays an analyte role, and any buffers used in the assay play reagent roles

3. An Assay (Detecting Expression Level and Location of a Protein of Interest)
In a immunocytochemicsty assay, the cells play an evaluant role, the endogenous protein of interest plays an analyte role, and the molecular labels (labeled antibody probe, fluorescent reporter), as well as any buffers, fixatives, and detergents used, play reagent roles.

This example illustrates how a given material entity (an antibody or fluorochrome) can bear many different research material roles (an incorporant role, an evaluant role, a reagent role), and how these roles are realized in different processes.</obo:IAO_0000112>

The reagent role is realized through the bearer&apos;s participation in such a process.

        <obo:IAO_0000115>v4 def (newest, 12-10-11):

a role inhering in a material entity that is (1) intended to be input into some scientific technique to facilitate the generation of data about some other entity, or the production of a material output that does not derive from the bearer of the reagent role unless the output is itself a reagent, and (2) comprised (only) of molecular-scale parts intended to participate in a chemical reaction or interaction during this technique

Note that if we say a reagent now consists only of the components of a material intended to participate in some reaction . . . we may now be able to say that a reagent is:

a role inhereing in a molecular entity (single or multi-chain entiteis or mixtures), or in the combined molecular parts of some larger material entity,  that are intended to participate in a chemical reaction or interaction as part of a scientific technique to generate data about some other entity, or produce some material output that does not derive from the bearer unless the output is itself a reagent.


This last part assures that things like dNTPs and P32 incorporated into an oligo probe bear reagent roles, as they are not used on their own in a reagent capacity, but rather are always incorported into some other molecular entity which has a reagent role.   So this means that ANY input into a material processing technique with a reagent creation objective (be it an incorporant or non-incorporant) realizes a reagent role in this process? Or is the reagent role of dNTPs realized only when the reagent role of the resulting PCR product (ie probe, construct/insert etc) is realized?  Same goes for construct inserts - are these reagents?   

So may say something like : &quot;. . . and realized in a scientific technique whereby the bearer (or a larger reagent of which it is a part) . . . &quot;</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <rdfs:comment>Note that if we go with newest approach for defining reagent role, we may not need the clause &apos;immediately consumed or inactivated&apos;.
In the definition for this class, this clause implies that a molecular reagent or molecular part of a non-molecular reagent is either physically altered or destroyed in a chemical reaction, or sequestered or otherwise indisposed by some molecular interaction, such that any potential re-use of the reagent would require material processing to restore it to a usable state (e.g. uncoupling and re-purifying an antibody, washing of bound probes and contaminants from a microarray plate, washing and re-culturing a cell line)</rdfs:comment>

&apos;Immediate consumption&apos; requires that the bearer&apos;s molecular parts are &apos;significantly altered&apos; during the execution of a single experiment, such that any re-use would require some processing to restore them to a usable state (e.g. washing of bound probes and contaminants from a microarray plate, washing and re-culturing of a cell line)</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <rdfs:comment>A key issue here is distinguishing non-molecular reagents (ie microarrays, cell lines) from instruments, which also are input into experiments and facilitate the generation of data about other entities or the production of other materials. However, entiteis we consider to be instruments typically do not have parts that participate in chemical reactions. For example, pipettes, tissue culture dishes, or microscopes, while often specified as inputs for tecniques that generate data about other entities or generated other material outputs, bear no components that participate in a chemical reaction or interaction during execution of this technique.

In a few cases, however, instuments DO have parts that participate in chemical reactions - for example the case of gel running boxes, which contain wires/electrodes that necessarily (ie as specified) exchange electrons and metal ions into the running buffer during an experiment.  It is to account for these cases that language was included in the &apos;reagent role&apos; definition that stipulates the &apos;immediate consumption or inactivation&apos; of reagents during execution of a technique. This excludes instruments that have parts which participate in chemical reactions (e.g. gel running boxes, pH meter probes), as their components (typically metal wires/electrodes) are chemically altered but not to the extent that they require restoration before running additional experiments.</rdfs:comment>

Because applying these roles to the universal class would indicate that ALL instances of cells or nucleic acids bear a specimen or reagent role, and this is not the case.

        <rdfs:comment>Created as a complement the molecular target role, and represent the molecular entity that seeks out and interacts with some molecular target of interest (according to some intentional agents specification, or some biological agents intent).  Here we consider only effectors used as reagents (wherease the molecular target is often not a reagent, and thus &apos;molecular target role&apos; is a research material role)

Molecular effector role is broadly conceived to cover targeted labels meant to facilitate detection of their targets, as well bioactive/pharmacological agents such as drugs, inhibitors, etc that are meant to effect the biological activity of their targets as a tool in some investigation.

Is always paried with some moleuclar target as another participant in the scientific technique, which is the more passive subject in this context. The effector participant can be said to be the one that is intended to seek out or recognizes the target.</rdfs:comment>

MH: i am a little concerned about classes like this one, which are not alive but are experimentally modified. not sure if the cell modification objective or cell modification techniques should apply to live only, or all cells? i think it really depends on how we define the &quot;modification&quot;- eg. material, physical, etc. does it matter if it is alive or dead? not sure.</obo:REO_0000144>

        <rdfs:comment>This class represents natural or artificial polymers that carry sequence information of a genetic nature (ie, information that is translatale to a nucleic acid sequence in a defined way - such that it can be aligned with or related to or translated into a sequence of nucleic acids).  In this sense, in encompasses a broader set of instances than ChEBI &apos;information biomacromolecule&apos;, which could be imported as a subclass of ReO:information macromolecule.

So, for ex, a morpholino is a synthetic oligo that is not made of nucleic acids, but it carries sequence information that relates each monomer to some specific nucleic acid or set of nucleic acids, allowing it to bind a nucleic acid an a sequence specific manner.

Other examples of &apos;genetic sequence macromolecules&apos; are other nucleic acid analogs such as locked nucleic acids or peptide nucleic acids, and synthetic primers or peptides, etc.</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:IAO_0000231>Not sure if I want to have size based classes as a primary axis for organic molecular entities, as this would require ontology developers and data annotators/curators to know the molecular weight of a given molecular entity before creating a class or annotation, respectively.  Also, this seems an arbitray way to classify a hierarchy of molecular entities.  Additionally, this could cause a problem if weight is unknown or borderline, and class is placed under the parent class of &apos;organic molecular entity&apos; . . . because then it wouldn’t classify as a chemical reagent, which would be defined as (&apos;inorganic molecular entity&apos; or &apos;organic small molecule&apos; or &apos;non-information organic macromolecule&apos;) and has_role some &apos;reagent role&apos; 

Consider removing this level and just having information and non-information molecular entities as direct children of &apos;organic molecular entity&apos;, along with &apos;nucleic acid reagent&apos; and &apos;organic small molecule&apos; defined classes.  

Then could change the definition of &apos;chemical reagent&apos; to (&apos;inorganic molecular entity or non-information molecular entity and (has_role some reagent role))</obo:IAO_0000231>

        <obo:IAO_0000116>1. In ReO, we consider the concept of &apos;small molecules&apos; broadly to include all organic molecules that are not macromolecules (ie not polypeptides, polynucleotides, or carbohydrates).  Conventionally, the term &apos;small molecule&apos; is usually restricted to a molecule that interact in some way with biological macromolecules (ie. are &apos;bioactive&apos;),  binding with high affinity a biopolymer such as protein, nucleic acid, or polysaccharide, often in such a way as to alter the activity or function of the biopolymer. The conventional upper molecular weight limit for a small molecule is approximately 800 Daltons, although no such restriction is made in ReO.

2. While most definitions of &apos;small molecule&apos; state that they are &apos;not polymers&apos;, allowance is often made for very short  peptides or nucleic acids (e.g. dinucleotides or short peptides such as glutathione).  However, in ReO we prioritize a clear distinction between macro- and small molecuese, and between molecules that carry genetic information and those that do not. Thus we consider small peptides or oligos to be macromolecules and NOT small molecule reagents (this includes examples such as the tri-peptide glutathione, which is technically not encoded in the genome, but synthesized chemically/directly from its constituent amino acids).</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <obo:REO_0000144>ChEBI: 4-11-12 Note that for now we are leaving out the notion of bio____.  (e.g. biomacromolecule), as the current definition of biomacromolecule in ChEBI is vague, reading  &apos;any macromolecule formed by a living organism&apos; - but it is not clear if this means literally produced in an organism, or &apos;of a type&apos; that is produced in an organism.  Need to ask ChEBI about this. Esp since they have things like &apos;locked nucleic acid&apos; and &apos;peptide nucleic acid&apos; as children - and these are artificial/synthetic moelcules.

For now, I can create a qualities &apos;biological&apos; (of a type produced in a living organism) and &apos;biologically produced&apos;/endogenously-derived&apos; (literally produced by a living organism), ans use these in axioms to capture this aspect/dimension of molecules or other materials.</obo:REO_0000144>
        <rdfs:comment>Note that key to the definition here is being comprised or repetition of some monomeric building block, and not any specific size constraint.  As a result, ReO would consider even a di-peptide or di-nucleotide to be a macromolecule.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Note that such molecules are not always amino acids themselves, in cases where the structural modifications made in creating the analog disrupt the amine or carboxyl functional groups that are required to be amino acids.  Most alterations, however, target the amino acid side chain, and thus most amino acid analogs qualify as amino acids.</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>This class is tagged as a secondary classificaiton axis because it is not necessarily disjoint from non-canonical amino acid reagent (ie amino acid analogs can include molecules that cornform to the definition of an amino acid but are artificially engineered to serve as analogs, and also molecules that are not amino acids at all but are designed to mimic them as analogs)</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:IAO_0000112>L-Photo-Leucine and L-Photo-Methionine are analogs of L-Leucine and L-Methionine amino acids that can be endogenously incorporated into the primary sequence of proteins during synthesis and then ultraviolet light (UV)-activated to covalently crosslink proteins within protein-protein interaction domains in their native environment within live cells.

Polyclonal antibodies are typically manufactured through an antibody production technique in which a host organism is immunized with a specific immunogen and antibodies purified from serum collected following the induced immune response. A collection of such antibodies has specificity for various different epitopes on its target antigen  - versus a collection of &apos;monoclonal antibodies&apos;, which all recognize a single epitope.  But at the structural level of the individual molecular reagent, there is of course no distinction between mono- and poly-clonal antibodies.</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <rdfs:comment>In practice, the notion of a polyclonal antibody is considered from the perspective of a collection of individual antibody complexes, where different antibodies in this collection may recognize distinct epitopes that are part of the same immunogen used in the generation of these antibodies. This feature results from the mode of their production whereby serum is collected directly from an immunized animal and antobodies purified for experimetnal use.  However at the structural level of the individual antibody molecule (which is considered here to be the antibody reagent), there is no physical distinction between an individual polyclonal antibody and an individual monoclonal antibody.  The difference derives from thier distinct modes of production, and the uniformity of molecules when they are collected and stored in solution.

Polyclonal antibody reagents are typically generated through a polyclonal antibody production technique in which antibodies are &apos;manufactured&apos; by artificially inducing an immune response in some organism and harvesting the antibodies produced as a result.  However, in some cases, antibodies existing &apos;naturally&apos; in some organism are characterized and found to be applicable as reagents.  Thus, we say that polyclonal antibody reagents can be output from an &apos;polyclonal antibody production&apos;, or from an &apos;specimen collection from an organism&apos;.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>note that many bearers of such a role will also have an activator function, becasue it was created/designed for the purpose of being an activator (e.g. ATP, or a ligant such as insulin).  However, in the context of biomedical experimentation, many chemicals are applied as activators that do not bear such a function (ie they were not created/designed to serve as activators, but are used to do so). Consider, for example, a calcium salt used to activate some ion channel in a mitochondrial prep to trigger the release apoptotic proteins. Here, calcium bears an activator role, but no an activator function. So we conceive of this as a reagent role realized in the context of an experiment or technique. </rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment> &apos;Natural&apos; and &apos;biological&apos; molecules can be synthetically manufactured, so long as they conform to the structural (for small molecules) or definitional (for macromolecules) requirements for some class of molecule that exists in nature (&apos;natural&apos;) or is endogenously produced by a living organism (&apos;biological&apos;).  

Note here that, requirements for synthetically-produced molecues to be considered &apos;natural&apos; or &apos;biological&apos; are different for small molecules vs macromolecules. A synthetic small molecules must exhibit structural identity (ie have the same molecular formula and structure) as some naturally-occurring molecule to be considered &apos;natural&apos;.  By contrast, we apply a looser qualifying standard for a syntheitc macromolcule to be considered &apos;natural&apos; or &apos;biological&apos;. A macromolecules is here considered to be &apos;natural&apos; or &apos;biological&apos; if it meets the structural requirements defining a type of macromolecule that is biologically produced (polypeptides, polynucleotides, or carbohydrates) - regardless of whether the molecule is actually produced naturally or synthetically, and regardless of wheter the sequence is actually found in nature.  

So a synthetic peptide is a type of natural, bioligical macromolecule, because its structural make-up conforms to the definition of a naturally-occurring biological macromolecule type (a protein), in that it is comprised of a linear chain of amino acids joined through peptide bonds. But agian, the sequence of the peptide does not need to represent a sequence found naturally. For macromolecules then, &apos;natural&apos; does not require precise molecular structure or sequence identity with a macromolecule found in nature (ie does not need to represent a sequence of monomeric units found naturally).  Rather, &apos;natural&apos; implies that the macromolecule conforms to the definitional requirements for a type found in nature, and &apos;biological&apos; further restricts this to types produced by living organisms.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Opinions and authorities vary as to whether some lipids can be considered to be macromolecules.  Here, we consider lipids to be small molecules, despite the fact that many can be quite large, since they are not true macromolecules in the sense that they are not comprised of repeating monomeric subunits. 
 
The term &apos;lipid&apos; covers a wide range of substances which contain moieties belonging chemically to hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, acids, amines or glucides. Accordingly, lipids cannot be defined structurally, but are rather defined by their chemical proeprties (ie their solubility in non-polar solvents). The majority of lipid  molecules are waxes, triacylglycerols, phospholipids and glycolipids. Other substances are also considered as lipids while belonging to other classes of molecules, e.g. fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K), coenzymes (ubiquinones), pigments (carotenoids), terpenes, phenolics and sterols.

&quot;One of the most common examples that confuses many students is to identify solvent and solute in vinegar. In vinegar solution, water is the solvent; whereas acetic acid is the solute. To be more precise, a liquid solute is dissolved in a liquid solvent in vinegar. Similarly, other solvent and solute examples are soda water (gas is solute and water is solvent) and steel (solid carbon dissolved in solvent iron).&quot;

        <rdfs:comment>The term &apos;lipid&apos; covers a wide range of substances which contain moieties belonging chemically to hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, acids, amines or glucides. Accordingly, lipids cannot be defined structurally, but are rather defined by their chemical proeprties (ie their solubility in non-polar solvents). The majority of lipid  molecules are waxes, triacylglycerols, phospholipids and glycolipids. Other substances are also considered as lipids while belonging to other classes of molecules, e.g. fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K), coenzymes (ubiquinones), pigments (carotenoids), terpenes, phenolics and sterols (adapted from http://www.cyberlipid.org/cyberlip/home0001.htm)

Opinions and authorities vary as to whether some lipids can be considered to be macromolecules (as opposed to orgnaic small molecules).  Here, we consider lipids to be small molecules, despite the fact that many can be quite large, since they are not true macromolecules in the sense that they are not comprised of repeating monomeric subunits. </rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Key features of these analogs is that (1) they exhibit some novel, unnatural function or role relative to some natural molecule which they are applied to mimic/stand in for, and (2) they are not naturally occurring themselves, either as independent molecular entities or as residues/components of larger macromolecules.  For example, a biotin-conjugated serine molecule would be considered an amio acid analog, as this chemical structure is not found in nature but could be used to replace natural serine in a polypeptide (and allow, for example, its purification using a streptavidin column).  By contrast, phosphate-conjugated serine molecule (O-phospho-L-serine)  represents a chemical structure found in nature (as part of a serine-phosphorylated polypeptide) - and thusdoes not introduce some novel, unnatural  function or role when applied in place of serine.

The presumption here is that there is a core set of natural/biological that biomedical researchers are interested in, which are afforded a special/conferred status (these are things like nucleotides, amino acids, monosaccharides, etc).  Accordingly, biochemists and chemical reagent manufacturers often synthesize artificial and unnatural &apos;analogs&apos; of them, which can be used to probe or alter the function of biological systems.  Thus, we see in ReO classes such as &apos;nucleotide analog&apos; and  &apos;amino acid analog&apos;.</rdfs:comment>

Many (inferred) children of this class represent categories of experimental modifications, that are distinguished based on various classification criteria:

1.  Type of material that is modified (e.g. cell modification technique, antibody conjugation technique)

2. Type of modification made (e.g. genetic modification technique, molecular labeling technique, imm8nization)

Design pattern for each mode of classification/type of defined class can be extended and consistently applied to create new defined classes as they may be needed in the future.

Design patterns: 

1. Based on type of material modified: 
  a. &apos;material processing technique&apos;  and (has_specified_input some (&apos;X&apos;  and (&apos;has role&apos; some &apos;target of physical modification role&apos;))) and (has_specified_output some &apos;X&apos;)

2. Based on type of modification made:
  a. indicate the specified inputs and the roles they have (e.g. molecular label with a material to be added, and material entity with a target of material addition) 
  b. document some attribute of the specified output that reflects the modification made (e.g. has specified output some cell and has proper part some (material genome and (bears concretization of some sequence alteration)
  c. use a more specific target of modification role (e.g. target of stable genetic modification role, target of transgenic modification role)

Use a or b when possible, and resort to c if necessary.</obo:REO_0000139>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>A key concept here is that an &apos;experimental modification&apos; is any technique that has some specified input that is intended to be modified. 
But to be &apos;experimentally modified&apos;, a material must not only be output from such an experimental modification, but it must also bear a &apos;target of physical modification role&apos; as input, which is realized in the technique.  This means that in techniques that can have specified outputs that are contextually modified or physically modified (for example an appendix removal that may have as specified output a contextually modified appendix or a physically modified organism), we can use the deisgn patterns in ReO to be precise as to which output is experimentally modified - the one that as input bore a &apos;target of physical modification role&apos;).</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:IAO_0000115>a material processing technique whereby physical alterations (ie structural or compositional changes) are made to a specified input material,  to produce some output that represents a modified version of the specified input material.</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>The purpose of modeling the notion of physical/experimental modification in this way is to be able to record that a given material has been experimentally modified - as this represents an important concept/distinction for researchers considering the nature of a given resource when they are  interpreting data, looking for resources, or planning experiments.  The founding use case for this was the need to logically model the CL class &apos;experimentally modified cell&apos; - where it was decided that &apos;experimental modification&apos; here was meant to imply some physical change to the cell (addition or removal or structural re-arrangement of material). This is contrasted with the notion of &apos;contextually modified&apos; - whereby a material entity undergoes a change in context/location, but no physical change is made to its internal, self-contained structure.  For example, an appendix surgically removed from an organism is contextually modified, and the organism itself is physically/experimentally modified.

This organizational class  (&apos;experimental modification&apos;) collects all material processing techniques considered to &apos;physically modify&apos; some specified input material.  We use &apos;target of physical modification&apos; roles inhering in the SPECIFIED inputs of material processing techniques to record the intent of the researcher to physically modify some input material. These roles inhere in a specified input material that an agent intends to modify and thereby produce a specified output representing a modified version of this target (ie there is a preservation of identity between the specified input bearing the &apos;target of physical modification role&apos; and the specified output of the process in which this role is realized).  

To define an experimentally modified material, we can indicate that it is output from some experimental modification that has_specified_output some entity X that bears a &apos;target of physical modification role&apos;, and that the specified output is also of type X (ie the specified output is that input which was the target of modification).  For example, a &apos;cell modification technique&apos; is defined as any experimental modification where the specified output is a cell that bears a &apos;target of physical modification role&apos;, and the specified output is also a cell.  An &apos;experimentally modified cell&apos; can then be defined as any cell that is output of such a technique.  Using this pattern, we are able to infer that a given class of material entities is &apos;experimentally modified&apos; based on their being output from a material processing technique that meets the criteria for experimental modification.

Note that not every specified output of an experimental modification qualifies as &apos;experimentally modified&apos; (e.g. an appendix output from an appendix removal). Only those output from experimental modification techniques where the specified output is the same as the specified input that bears a &apos;target of physical modification role&apos; (e.g. the organism from which the appendix was removed).  Thus, we create experimental modification technique subclasses of &apos;experimental modification&apos; to specify this (ie that the specified output of a &apos;cell modfiication technique&apos; is of the same type as the specified input that is to be modified - ie a cell), and use these in our definitions of specific types of experimentally modified entities (e.g. experimentally modified cell).</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:IAO_0000112>Experimental modifications are those that ADD material, REMOVE material, or REARRANGE material:

Adding Material: labeling a cell with biotin, conjugating an antibody with a fluorochrome, transfecting cells in culture, fixation of a tissue specimen, ubiquitination of a recombinant protein, immunization of an organism

Removing Material: surgical removal of an anatomical entity or  tumor form an organism, enzymatic digestion of cell surface proteins on a cell, dephosphorylation of a recombinant protein

Rearranging Material - homogenization of a tissue sample, introducing a point mutation into the genome of some cell</obo:IAO_0000112>
        <rdfs:comment>An experimental modification makes physical changes to some input material representing a &apos;target of physical modification&apos;, and a modified version of this same material entity is specified as output ( (ie shares identity with the input target of modification).  The &apos;physical&apos; changes refered to in the definition alter the structural makeup of the input material by adding/removing material or re-arranging their internal structure. These are changes beyond simple &apos;contextual changes&apos; such those resulting from, for example, collecting a specimen, or selecting a subpopulation of cells.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Note that the endogneous antigen role can be realized in the context of an experimental technique, where the antigen is applied to initiate an immune response in an immune-competent system as part of the experiment.  So andogenous antigen and experimental antigen classes are not disjoint, as a given instance could belong to both classes.</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:REO_0000181>OBI: antigen role? (assuming we clarify the definition here)</obo:REO_0000181>
        <rdfs:comment>Note that a bearer of this role can also bear an experimental antigen role. For example, if a protocol specifies an antigen to stimulate an immune response is as part of some experiment (e.g. in studying the immune response itself, or its byproducts), the antigen is an endogenous antigen and an experimental antigen.  However, in the majority of cases, the experimental antigen is recognized simply to allow for its detection in some fixed/prepared specimen - and not to applied to trigger an immune response.

Note malso another important distinction : any molecule interacting with an adaptive immune receptor (to allow for its detection or to trigger a GENERAL immune response) bears an antigen role.  If the interaction triggers an ADAPTIVE immune response, then the molecule additionally bears an immunogen role.</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:IAO_0000231>decided this class was not necessary, and would define experimental antibody targets as has_part some (has_role some experimental antigen role).

is_realized_by some

        <rdfs:comment>This class allows us to talk about the material entity which an antibody is used to target in an experiment, even in cases where the actual antigen is not known (e.g. antibodies known to recognize a certain cell or organelle type, for example, but where the actual molecular antigen associated with these targets is not known).  

As the part_of relation is reflexive, it is acceptible for antigens themselves to bear a material antibody target role, and thus be material antibody targets.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>The key feature here is that some aspect of the structure of any bearer of this quality was designed or specified in some way by an intentional agent.</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000112>Bearers of this quality can include artificial molecules with no naturally-occurring counterpart (e.g. syntheitic drugs such as methotrexate), and molecules designed to exactly reproduce naturally-occurring molecules (e.g. chemically synthesized amino acids, chemically synthesized natural products). Several additional examples are provided below relating to bioengineered proteins (as this is the most common application for the &apos;engineered&apos; quality): 

1. A recombinant protein is considered bioengineered, as its sequence is precisely and completely specified through the engineering of a recombinant DNA construct, which serves as the genetic template for transcription and translation processes used to generate the recombinant protein

2. An antibody reagent produced through an antibody production  technique where an organism is exposed to an immunogen with the intent of exploiting the adaptive immune response to produce an antibody that will bear a sequence in its paratope which recognizes the immunogen designed and used in its production

3. A non-example is insulin generated through the stimulation of a pancreatic beta cell line with glucose in order to stimulate its secretion. Here, the insulin produced is not considered &apos;bioengineered&apos;, because despite being output from some planned process,  its sequence was not designed or engineered in any way by an intentional agent.

Cell lines are also non-examples, as the production of the line itself is not through a biological process, but through some &apos;establishing cell culture&apos;.  (cell culture cells, on the other hand, might be considered bioengineered)</obo:IAO_0000112>

        <rdfs:comment>In biology, in situ means to examine the phenomenon exactly in place where it occurs (i.e. without moving it to some special medium).

This phrase in situ when used in laboratory science such as cell science can mean something intermediate between in vivo and in vitro. For example, examining a cell within a whole organ intact and under perfusion may be in situ investigation. This would not be in vivo as the donor is sacrificed before experimentation, but it would not be the same as working with the cell alone (a common scenario for in vitro experiments).</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>This class essentially represents sequence encoded by any nucleic acid molecule or nucleic acid span that is experimentally introduced as genetic material into a cell or organism.  This sequence is typically not represented in the reference genome of the host cell, and often it is trans-genomic - i.e. its sequence content is represented in the refernce genome of some organism other than that into which it is introduced.  However, this sequence CAN represent a duplicaiton of sequence existing in the host cell&apos;s natural genome (ie the introduced nucleic acid encodes an additional copy of a sequence that IS part of a reference genome for the host cell&apos;s source organism) </rdfs:comment>

        <obo:IAO_0000116>Note that the nucleic acid bearer of this sequence contained in a cell or organism in such a way as to be stably replicated in its host (and is therefore considered heritable &apos;genetic material&apos;). Note also that we consider here only foreign genomic sequence that is the result of an experimental procedure (ie this class does not cover naturally occuring cases of genetic material transfered between organisms)</obo:IAO_0000116>
        <obo:IAO_0000115>a genomic sequence region that is encoded by genetic material that is experimentally introduced into a cell or organism.  Note that the bearer of such sequence is experimentally introduced &apos;genetic material&apos;, and therefore is necessarily: (1) a proper_part_of some host cell or organism; (2) heritable by the progeny of this host, such that the sequence content it encodes is stably propagated in subsequent generations of cells; and (3) not a &apos;natural&apos; part of the host&apos;s physical genome.</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <obo:IAO_0000112>sequence information carreid by a exogneous transposon element introduced into the genomic DNA of some host cell. 

Regardless of whether this introduced material represented seqence found in the host cells genome or not, if is still considered to to carry extra-genomic information.  For example, sequence found in a recombinant plasmid that represent an endogenous human gene and is stably overexpressed in a human cell line would represent extra-genomic sequence but not trans-genomic sequence. </obo:IAO_0000112>

        <rdfs:comment>Typically refers to constructs that carry inserts encoding non-coding sequences (e.g. intronic regions, regulatory regions, inter-geneic sequences, etc)  that are uniquely characteristic of genomic DNA (as opposed to cDNA) . . . such that a construct encoding a single exon from a gene would not qualify as a genomic construct, despite encoding only a genomic sequence region.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>1. a genomic nucleic acid molecule must in its entirety represent genomic sequence - thus it does not include things like cDNA reverse transcribed from some mRNA transcript, where introns and other genomic features are missing.  

2. genomic nucleic acid does not necessarily need to physically derive from the genome of an organism - only encode sequence from the genome of some reference organism (so things like PCR products can qualify)

3. a genomic nucleic acid molecule does not need to be part of a cell or organism (i.e.an  experimentally isolated genomic DNA prep, or a PCR product, would qualify)

4. genomic nucleic acid can be single or double stranded - it is the sequence information content of the molecule that matters, and this can be carried by single or double stranded nucleic acid</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>A note on the distinction between &apos;genomic&apos; and &apos;genetic&apos; material:
&apos;genomic material&apos; need only encode sequence representing the genome of some organism.  &apos;genetic material&apos; must additionally be part of a cell or organism where it can be stable replicated and inherited by progeny.</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <obo:IAO_0000116>1. Genetic material here is considered as a DNA or RNA molecule that is found in a cell or virus, and capable of being replicated and inherited by progeny cells or virus. As such, this nucleic acid is either chromosomal DNA, or some replicative epi-chromosomal plasmid or transposon. 

2. Genetic material need not be inherited from an immediate ancestor cell or organism (e.g. a replicative plasmid or transposon acquired through some experimental modification), but must be capable of being inherited by progeny cells or organism.

3. Genetic material necessarily bears the concretization of some genomic sequence region.  However, note that this relation is not reciprocal, in that a genomic sequence region is not necessarily encoded by genetic material (ie. it can also be encoded by nucleic acids that are not heritable parts of a cell or virus, such as PCR products or synthetic oligos, where the sequence encoded represents that from the genome of some organsim)</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <obo:IAO_0000112>A recombinant protein production technique is an example where the sequence of the bioengineered protein is directly and precisely and completely specified through the engineering of a recombinant DNA construct that serves as the genetic template for transcription and translation.

An antibody production technique is an example where the exact sequence of specified output antibodies is not fully specified, but is determined by the administration of some immunogen that triggers the immune system to produce antibodies that will bear a sequence in their paratope that will recognize the specified immunogen.

A non-example is the stimulation of a pancreatic beta cell line with glucose in order to stimulate the secretion of insulin.  Here, the insulin produced is not considered &apos;bioengineered&apos;, because despite being output from some planned process,  its sequence was not designed or engineered in any way by an intentional agent.</obo:IAO_0000112>

        <rdfs:comment>This class essentially represents any nucleic acid molecule or nucleic acid span that is experimentally introduced as genetic material into a cell or organism.  Such nucleic acid in practice are typically &apos;trans-genomic&apos;&apos; - ie thier sequence content is not represented in a reference genome of the host cell&apos;s source organism. However, exogenously supplied nucleic acid bearing duplicated genomic sequence (ie a foreign nucleic acid that encodes additional copies of a sequence that IS part of a reference genome for the host cell&apos;s source organism) also qualifies as &apos;modified genetic material&apos;</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000112>Exogenous epichromosomal examples are independent nucleic acid molecules, and include plasmids capable of stable replication introduced into a bacterai strain, or replicative transposons introduced into some cell line.  

Integral chromosomal examples are &apos;nucleic acid spans&apos;, and include inserted spans or mutated residues that change the natural sequence of the host&apos;s genetic material.

2. A note on the distinction between &apos;genetic material&apos; and &apos;modified genetic material&apos; - the latter is not a child of the former because &apos;genetic material&apos; is always an independently-existing molecular entity.  By contrast, &apos;modified genetic material&apos; can refer to such an independent molecular entity, but also to parts of such entities (ie &apos;nucleic acid spans&apos;) that represent modifeid sequence (e.g. nucleic acid spans inserted into the chromosomal genome of a cell).  Such molecular parts are modeled as &apos;chemical groups&apos; (according to the ChEBI framework we adopt for ReO).</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <rdfs:comment>A genome is the collection of all nucleic acids in a cell or virus, representing all of an organism&apos;s hereditary information. It is typically DNa, but many viruses have RNA genomoes. The genome includes both nuclear chromosomes (ie nuclear and micronucleus chromosomes) and cytoplasmic chromosomes stored in various organelles (e.g. mitochondrial or chloroplast chromosomes), as well as non-chromosomal elements such as replicative viruses, plasmids, and transposable elements.</rdfs:comment>
        <obo:IAO_0000115>a material entity that represents all genetic material in a cell or virion.  The material genome is typically molecular aggregate of all the chromosomal DNA and epi-chromosomal DNA that represents all sequences that are heritable by progeny of a cell or virion.</obo:IAO_0000115>
        <obo:IAO_0000116>Note that a material genome is necessarily part of some cell or virion, so a genomic library is not considered a material genome.  Rather, we could say that this genomic library bears the concretization of some genome (as the genome sequence entity allows for such cases).</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <obo:IAO_0000115>a material processing technique with the goal of producing an organism that stably carries some transgenic genetic material (ie encoding sequence from the genome of some other organism). 

This can be achieved through:
(1) de novo creation of a transgenic organism - using embryonic stem cells into which genomic sequence alterations have been made through addition of exogneous genes from other organisms.  In the case of genetically modified virus, this is achieved  through the transfection of plasmids encoding a transgene of interest along with viral coat protein, replication, and packaging genes that encode the machinery necessary  to assemble a viral capsid containing the transgene and secrete it from the transfected cells; 
or
(2) by modification of an existing organism through the stable introduction of an exogneous trasngene into one or more cells from the organism. </obo:IAO_0000115>

        <obo:REO_0000144>OBI (re: clarification of OBI class label &apos;genetic transformation&apos;: a technique involving the alteration of existing genetic material of a target cell or organism, or the introduction of exogenous DNA to be expressed in a cell or organism). 

1. The OBI definition is vague here. they reference &apos;genetic material&apos; in their textual definition, but this term is not defined in OBI proper.  It is tentatively defined in OBI exp design, however, to include only stably inherited genetic content of a cell or organism.  However, transfection is a child of genetic transformation in OBI, and not all transfections (arguable, none of them) result in stable, heritable alterations to genetic material.  If this is the case, we should not import here, as meaning is different than what we intend with &apos;genetic modification technique&apos;.  Consider making two classes in ReO: &apos;genetic modification technique&apos; being more inclusive, and including things like stable transfections (since these are material delivery and thus modifications), and then the subtype &apos;stable/heritable/integral genetic modification technique&apos; or &apos;genetic material modification technique&apos;  to be equivalent to my current meaning here - where genetic material is truly modified.

2. Note that using our design pattern here, we are able to create defined classes for all asserted children of the OBI:genetic transformation class (e.g. induced mutation, gene knock in, etc)

3. Note that we at one time importedOBI:genetic trasnformation here, but not clear that their meaning is same as ours.  For example, ReO uses this class to describe only modifications that result in heritable, stable changes to the genetic material of a cell or organism.  So we do NOT include cases such as transfections, where the added genetic material may not be capable of stable replication and propagation to progenitors.  While such process allow for expression of exogenous genes in a target cell or organism,  there is no stable, heritable changes to what we consider to be the &apos;genetic material&apos; of the target.

Therefore, we COULD apply the axiom  encoded_in_material_bearer only (&apos;nucleic acid&apos; or (object_aggregate and (has_aggregate_part only &apos;nucleic acid&apos;))), rather than encoded_in_material_bearer only &apos;genetic material&apos; (as &apos;genetic material&apos; is defined as necessarily part of some particular cell or virion) . . .but note below that this may have casued issues upon classification (ie material genome classifying as a nucleic acid)</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <rdfs:comment>A genome is the entirety of sequence representing an organism&apos;s hereditary information. It is encoded either in DNA or, for many types of virus, in RNA. The genome sequence includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences, and it includes sequence of both nuclear chromosomes (ie nuclear and micronucleus chromosomes) and cytoplasmic chromosomes stored in various organelles (e.g. mitochondrial or chloroplast chromosomes), as well as sequence encoded in nonchromosomal elements such as replicative viruses, plasmids, and transposable elements.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://www.ifomis.org/bfo/1.1/snap#Role">
        <obo:REO_0000139>In regards to use of roles, functions, and dispositions in ReO: 

Note that we use roles for the vast majority of dependent continuants inhering in our material entities, despite the fact that these roles always exploit more fundamental functions or dispositions. This is because we are concerned with the domain of scientific techniques and experimentation, where the intentions of researchers performing such processes is paramount. The more fundamental functions and dispositions that inhere in reagents, as a consequence of their inherent physical structures, are important in that they support the roles realized in experimental contexts according to researcher specifications. But to avoid overly complex and proliferative modeling, most of these dispositions and functions are considered out of scope for ReO, and left to other efforts to model. 

For example, most bearers of molecular effector roles in ReO additionally bear a more fundamental molecular binding function (as the bearers are often created for the purpose of binding some target . . . eg antibodies are created through biological processes for the purpose of recognizing/binding to antigens, probes are created typically through some synthetic process with the function to bind some target molecule). And this binding function could also be said to exploit an even more fundamental binding disposition. But because ReO is concerned primarily with human intention associated with the bearers of these dependent continuants, we concern ourselves primarily with modeling them as roles - as roles are borne in virtue of some agents intent or context (note that the binding disposition and function mentioned above are one example that is modeled in ReO)

As an example of the issues that arise if we try to model functions and dispositions, consider the case of a ‘molecular activator’ reagent applied in an experiment. We could model this as a molecular entity that bears a reagent role and also bears a molecular activator function. But there are also cases where activators used in experiments activate some target not through realization of a function, but through realization of a disposition (e.g. certain salts or metals might be applied to activate ion channels, but certainly these chemicals were not created for the purpose of ion channel activation, and thus would have an activator disposition rather than function). So to model this in ReO,we would have to create both a molecular activator function and molecular activator disposition, and say that a molecular activator is a molecular entity that bears a reagent role and also bears a (molecular activator function or molecular activator disposition). Obviously, the creation, definition, and management of all these classes gets unwieldy. So to avoid such complexity, and represent the fact that we are concerned with intended applications of materials in experiments (ie roles they play) we simply say that molecular activators bear some molecular activator role, which is a subclass of reagent role.

Functions and dispositions are used in some cases, however, when it is appropriate (ie DNA constructs bear a genetic vector function, because all members of this class are created with this purpose in mind).  Functions are also seen in some cases to be used in defining equivalent classes, when all members of a defined class do clearly share a common function or disposition that is necessary and sufficient for membership in the class. For example, fluorescent reporter is defined as a molecular entity that bears a molecular reporter role and also a fluorescence disposition.

        <rdfs:comment>Polarity refers to a separation of electric charge leading to a molecule or its chemical groups having an electric dipole or multipole moment. Molecular polarity is dependent on the difference in electronegativity between atoms in a compound and the asymmetry of the compound&apos;s structure. Polarity underlies a number of physical properties including surface tension, solubility, and melting- and boiling-points.</rdfs:comment>

At the meta level, universals are defined as positives, are disjoint with their siblings, have single asserted parents.   Defined classes are non-universals, or classes based on some secondary axis of classification that may or may not result in complete and disjoint partitioning of its parent class.</rdfs:comment>

        <obo:REO_0000144>RO - this class has two parents - should only have obsoleteClass as a parent since it was obsoleted (see reasons for obsoleting improper_part_of : OBSOLETE. The definition is &quot;As for part_of, with the additional constraint that subject and object may be identical&quot;. However, part_of is already reflexive, therefore improper_part_of is identical to part_of. If read differently, as &quot;improper_part_of is part_of but not proper_part_of&quot;,improper_part_of becomes identity. So, improper_part_of is either identical to part_of or to identity, and not an intuitive synonym for either of them. [Robert Hoehndorf])

Ultimately, will replace RO with BFO2 relations, so may not be an issue for us.</obo:REO_0000144>

    <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://www.obofoundry.org/ro/ro.owl#has_improper_part">
        <obo:REO_0000144>RO - this class has two parents - should only have obsoleteClass as a parent since it was obsoleted (see reasons for obsoleting improper_part_of : OBSOLETE. The definition is &quot;As for part_of, with the additional constraint that subject and object may be identical&quot;. However, part_of is already reflexive, therefore improper_part_of is identical to part_of. If read differently, as &quot;improper_part_of is part_of but not proper_part_of&quot;,improper_part_of becomes identity. So, improper_part_of is either identical to part_of or to identity, and not an intuitive synonym for either of them. [Robert Hoehndorf])

Ultimately, will replace RO with BFO2 relations, so may not be an issue for us.</obo:REO_0000144>
