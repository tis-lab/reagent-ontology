        <obo:REO_0000192>previous definition of this class required material input: techniques are performed by some human agent (as opposed to a computer or software agent), and have material inputs, such that computational data transformations and statistical analyses do not qualify (these planned processes would be described by &apos;plan specifications&apos; such as an &apos;algorithm&apos; or &apos;software&apos;, not a protocol).  But decided against this - such that data transformations and analyses performed by humans can be considered techniques.</obo:REO_0000192>
        <obo:REO_0000192>OBO Foundry, OBI (Many planned processes in OBI are imported or considered in ReO as types of techniques, thereby constricting the extension of these classes to cover only those planned processes that are related to scientific investigations.  This seems acceptable, given that this is the scope of OBI and ReO, however it may limit the re-usability of these classes by external ontologies that deal with thnkgs like material processing or data processing outside the context of investigations.  This may, of course, be perfectly fine if we dont want OBI/ReO classes re-used in such contexts . . . which we likely do not.)

NIF - seems to be equivalent to their &apos;protocol application&apos; class?  Although this is not well defined in NIF and defers to OBI to define it and merge once OBI has done so.</obo:REO_0000192>

    <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000681">
        <obo:REO_0000208>Note that the identity/existence of the input &apos;target of material separation&apos;  typically persists through the separation process*, such that this process outputs a &apos;physically&apos; modified version of this input target (in virtue of its loosing some material components), as well as a &apos;contextually&apos; material that was separated from the target. The desired output specified by this objective can be either of these outputs - the now modified target of the material separation itself, or the material that was separated from this target.  Depending on which of these is the primary specified output, the separation process may be said to have a &apos;physical&apos; or &apos;contextual&apos; separation objective.

* the exception would be a fractionation process, which completely partitions an input material into fractions which are meant to be different in composition.</obo:REO_0000208>
        <obo:REO_0000208>&apos;material component separation from target objective&apos; would parallel nicely the name of the related class in the material combination hierarchy.  Would use this because it captures the idea that there is some larger target from which desired components are to be separated for a particular purpose, whereas the remainder is not relevant for that purpose.  Note that this is OK even in cases such as fractionation where the entire input may be retained as specified output, but there is a separate objective for each output that says this portion is relevant and the rest is not for this particular purpose - even the the rest is relevant for some other purpose that is captured in a different objective . . . so here we are saying that a single process can have many different/separate objectives - ie separating a cell culture into cytosol vs nuclear vs membrane fractions represents three objectives achieved in the same process - such that for the cytosol separation objective there is the desired output (the cytosol) and the nuclear and membrane fractions are not relevant for that objective but are relevant for other objectives tied to the fractionation process)

        <obo:REO_0000192>11-4-11 - material processing is defined here as broadly as possible, to include any planned process where material input is spatially re-organized or undergoes structural changes.  In this way, processes such as material separation, material collection, material combination, and specimen creation, will classify as material processing.  

In ReO, i have manually asserted membership in this class instead of applying the achieves planned objective axiom to all classes I want to infer as members.

To have classes infer as memebrs of material processing, we could try a deisgn pattern where we say that material processing is a &apos;planned process&apos; and has_specified_output only &apos;material entity&apos;, OR achieves_planned objective some material transformation objective.  This allows us to avoid having to attach objectives to all classes in order to have them qualify as material processings (e.g. material colleciton, specimen collection), as being a planned process and having an output that is a material entity should be sufficient.</obo:REO_0000192>
        <obo:REO_0000192>11-14-11 - Seeing this term in a new light now - a material processing is not just any planned process that has material input and output.  Rather, the objective of this process is critical . . . ie the objective to transform some input material into some desired output material which is the target of the plan specification - not just a material transformation occurs.</obo:REO_0000192>
        <obo:REO_0000208>Old definition notes : 

This includes processes such as material component separation and combination, as well as changes that alter the internal arrangement of an input material.

OR

a planned process which results in specified reorganization or structural changes to some input material, to generate some research material as output. This includes processes such as material component separation and combination,  as well as changes that alter the internal arrangement of an input material at a molecular or macroscopic level.

OR

A planned process which results in physical changes to a specified input material, such that matter comprising the input material is re-arranged at some level of granularity to generate some specified output material. Material processing is defined here as broadly as possible, to include any planned process where material input is spatially re-organized or undergoes structural changes.</obo:REO_0000208>
        <obo:REO_0000208>We changed our minds on the below, and thus have reinstated the distinction between ReO material processing technique and OBI material processing, creating classes for each.

We have decided for now to import the OBI material processing class and change label to material processing technique, as for our purposes all material processings in the scope of ReO and OBi (and likely all of the OBO foundry), have specified outputs of research materials (thus making them all reo:material processing techniques as we originally conceived of this class).  So to ease integration with OBI, the OBI material processing class was re-used here in this way, with a modified definition and additional axioms, including an extended logical definition to include the statement that the output must be a research materisl (which i beleive to be consistent with the implicit meaning of this class in OBI)

So, in ReO, this class is used to subsume all techniques that generate or prepare materials for potential use in an investigation (ie via synthesis, collection, purification, etc).  Investigations here are considered broadly to include any planned processes aimed at producing information of a scientific nature, including activities as simple as collecting and storing a specimen for visual observation, where the visual observation is a type of scientific analysis where data about the physical properties of the specimen are gathered and analyzed.</obo:REO_0000208>

HOW DEAL WITH THIS HAVING A ROLE THAT IS REALIZED DURING A TECHNIQUE?  NOW I SAY THAT THIS ROLE IS REALIZED BY SOME PART OF SOME TECHNIQUE - BUT NOT SURE THIS IS RIGHT.

Note that this will not infer as a type of antigenic material using the most correct logical definition (material_entity and (has_part some (&apos;has role&apos; some &apos;experimental antigen role&apos;))) - even though this should clearly qualify it to be an antigenic material.  So settled here for the logical def (material_entity and (is_recognized_by some &apos;antibody reagent&apos;) - which allows for proper classification but does not really reflect what this class is meant to represent.</obo:REO_0000787>

        <obo:REO_0000192>The explanation below is no longer the case - see notes on obsolete experimental modification objective class

---
Note here that a experimental modification process need not always output some modified version of some input.  Rather, this could be some de novo synthesis of a chemical that is INTENDED to represent some modified version of some specified reference chemical. 

This is because we want to use the term &apos;experimentally modified&apos; to refer to any structurally altered version of some specified object, whether it results from a process where unmodified version is input and modified version is output, or where the modified version of the reference object is produced de novo, for ex through chemical synthesis.  So, to be able to have classes such as &apos;experimentally modified cell&apos; or &apos;experimentally modified amino acid&apos; that cover both possibilities above, we need to be sure that &apos;material modification objective&apos; is defined accordingly, as this objective will be used to define an experimental modification technique which is used to define any experimentally modified material (ie the material is output of a exp mod technique, which in turn has a material mod obj.)  

e.g. de novo synthesis of a modified amino acid such as phospho-serine need not have serine as input, or even as a reaction intermediate during the chemical synthesis. The important part is that there is some specified reference object (serine) that an agent intends to create a structurally modified version of through the material modification process.

So, perhaps better to call this a modified-material production process?</obo:REO_0000192>

        <obo:REO_0000192>PROBLEM: Here, it our logical definition says that realization of a reagent role only through a particualr type of assay (detection of label) is sufficient to define a molecular label.  (There is no unifying function or disposition to cover all cases).  BUT this is not the case, as other reagent roles may be realized in such an assay (e.g. a buffer role), such that a buffer used in a detection of label assay could be wrongly inferred to be a molecular label.

2. ~8-25-12 Oddly, when I use the OBI class here it does not infer as a type of experimental modification, but if I duplicate the OBI class and replace all usages of the OBI class with this duplicated class (so essentially this duplicated class is identical in axioms and usage to the OBI class) - this duplicated class now classifies correctly.  Only real difference is in some of the annotation properties ( e.g. all of them live in ReO, and the label of the duplicated class is &apos;genetic modification technique&apos;, as opposed to this being a ReO alternative label for &apos;genetic transformation&apos; - the original OBI label)

        <obo:REO_0000192>1.

2. Note that i had previously defined this class using a &apos;genetic modification objective&apos;, but wanted to be consistent with how experimental modification and cell modification were defined (ie not using an objective, but rather roles inhering in experimental inputs).  
First attempt here was to use the axiom:

&apos;material processing technique&apos;
 and (has_specified_input some 
    ((cell
     or organism
     or &apos;cell culture&apos;)
     and (&apos;has role&apos; some &apos;target of genetic modification role&apos;)))
 and (has_specified_output some &apos;genetically modified material&apos;)

but this led to cell culture immortalization and cell culture transformation not inferring here (because this classification relied on the outputs of these processes being genetically modified materials, and the classification of the outputs as genetically modified materials relied on these techniques classifying as genetic modification techniques - so there was a reciprocal reliance that was not working.  Therefore, second attempt was the following:

&apos;material processing technique&apos;
 and (has_specified_input some 
    ((cell
     or organism
     or &apos;cell culture&apos;)
     and (&apos;has role&apos; some &apos;target of genetic modification role&apos;)))

AN ALTERNATE APPROACH (one not taken here) would be to subclass the current OBI objectives into &apos;contextual&apos; vs &apos;physical&apos; children (e.g. &apos;contextual material separation objective&apos; would apply to an appendix removal in which the specified output is the appendix, and &apos;physical material separation objective&apos; would apply to the case where the specified output is the mouse) - but this was deemed less practical than the current approach of recording this intent as roles inhering in the specified output of a material processing. technique.

        <obo:REO_0000208>Obsolete as of 8-5-12 when applied slightly different approach for modeling the notion of experimental modification.

Note that we use roles inhering in SPECIFIED outputs of material processing techniques to record the intent of the researcher with respect to their objective to physically modify some input material.
The notion of a SPECIFIED output allows us to indicate that a particular output of a processing technique holds special status (as the desired output to be further applied, processed, or characterized).  We use this concept to define &apos;experimental modification&apos; techniques as those where a &apos;target of physical modification role&apos; inheres in this SPECIFIED output - ie some agent intends that some input material will be physically altered and then returned as output.  Consider the example of removing an appendix from a mouse model organism.  This technique has two primary outputs: an appendix and the mouse now lacking an appendix.  The appendix is &apos;contextually&apos; modified, in that it is &apos;relocated&apos; to new surroundings but its internal, self-contained structure remains unaltered. The mouse is &apos;physically&apos; modified, in that it has undergone a compositional change thorough losing its appendix. This technique is an &apos;experimental modification&apos;
it the SPECIFIED output according to the objectives of the researcher is the mouse - as this is the output that has undergone a physical change.  If the specified output is the appendix, the objective is not one of physical modification and thus this is not an &apos;experimental modification&apos; technique.

We indicate this in ReO by asserting that both the specified input and specified output of an &apos;experimental modification&apos; technique bear a &apos;target of physical modification role&apos;. This allows us to accurately define an &apos;experimentally modified cell&apos;, for example, as any cell that is the specified output from an &apos;experimental modification&apos; - because the definition of this technique holds that its specified output is a target of phsyical modification.

Note that such distinctions are not possible using the current set of &apos;objective specifications&apos; in OBI, such as &apos;material component separation objective&apos; which would apply to an appendix removal.  As we have seen, outputs of separations can be contextually modified (the appendix) or physically modified (the mouse), and these objectives are agnostic as to which output of a separation is SPECIFIED by the researcher. Thus, they are not sufficient to let us define what materials are experimentally modified based on their being output from a technique with a particular objective.

To model experimental modification  will require either: 

(1) applying two objectives (one to specify the physical processing done- e.g. material separation), and one to describe the type of modifications desired (contextual vs physical)

or

(2) applying an objective to specify the physical processing done- e.g. material separation - , and a role to the specified input to indicate the type of modifications desired (contextual vs physical)
	
I chose #2 for now. . .</obo:REO_0000192>
        <obo:REO_0000192>8-28-12:

The notion of experimental modification and experimentally modified are not yet precisely modeled.

As of now (8-28-12), exp mod is defined simple as :
&apos;material processing technique&apos;  and (has_specified_input some  (material_entity
     and (&apos;has role&apos; some &apos;target of physical modification role&apos;)))

There is no requirement here that the specified output is the material that bears the target of physical modification role, because as  far as I know we cannot say this using OWL.  If we allow for inputs that are not going to be derived_into the specified output to bear target of physical modification roles, then  we are left with the scenario that WBCs output from some WBC extraction technique will be considered experimentally modified if the organism from which they derive bears a target of physical modification/material removal role.  

We could of course restrict the target of physical modification roles to apply only to inputs that will derive into specified outputs - which we can say textually but not logically - which is problematic because we want experimental modification to be a defined class where all techniques qualifying based on their axioms can be grouped/inferred - and this is the ultimate goal . . . to have techniques infer as experimental modifications based on some relatively simple axiomatic requirements.

We can begin to do this for more specific types of experimental modification - for example, cell modification technique can be defined as:
&apos;material processing technique&apos;  and (has_specified_input some  (cell   and (&apos;has role&apos; some &apos;target of physical modification role&apos;)))  and (has_specified_output some cell)

We could then say any cell that is output from such a technique is an experimentally modified cell - but this is problematic for cases such as biotin-labeled cell or genetically modified cell - where there is no named/implemented class specific for these types of modifications of CELLS.   so we are left now defining experimentally modified cell as a cell that is output from some experimental modification.  

-----

We are aware that this is not precise enough to ensure that all classes and instances inferring here are indeed experimentally modified.  Recall that our notion of &apos;experimentally modified&apos; requires a material that is the target of some physical modification to be input into some material processing technique, and be the specified output of this technique.  We have loosely defined an &apos;experimental modification&apos; as any material processing technique that takes as input some material with a &apos;target of physical modification role&apos;.  This means that not every output of a experimental modification will qualify as &apos;experimentally modified&apos;. For example, consider a WBC extraction technique that takes as input some organism that is the target of material removal, and specifies the output of some WBCs.  These cells are the specified output of an &apos;experimental modification&apos;, but are themselves not considered physically/experimentally modified (only &apos;contextually&apos; modified).

Rather, for a material &apos;X&apos; to be considered &apos;experimentally modified&apos;, it must not only be the specified output of some experimental modification, but &apos;X&apos; must be input with a &apos;target of physical modification role&apos; that is realized in this technique (such that the WBCs in the example above are not experimentally modified despite being the specified output of an experimental modification, because they did not bear a target of modification role . .  . the organism from which they came bore this role, but is not the specified output of this technique).

So, we may try to use here a stricter definition that an &apos;experimentally modified cell&apos; is the specified output of some &apos;cell modification technique, which is defined to be clear that a cell input has a target of physical modification role, and a cell is the specified output.  (or, spell out the logical definition of the &apos;cell modification technique&apos; class, so that materials such as a biotin labeled cell or a genetically modified cell for which there is no named cell modification class from which they are output, can still classify based on the axioms  used to describe these classes . . . but based on some tests with DL query I don’t think this is necessary - biotin labeled cell can still be inferred as an output of a cell modification technique when it is described as: is_specified_output_of some (&apos;molecular labeling technique&apos; and ((has_specified_input some (cell and (&apos;has role&apos; some &apos;target of material addition role&apos;))) and (has_specified_output some cell))).  This is unwieldy to say the least - and I don’t think I want to require such complexity just for the sake of perfectly precise inference of experimentally modified materials which is not a priority use case.

such modifications are common and conventionally might be considered/looked for under &apos;experimental modification&apos;.

Recall that based on average monomer weight, nucleic acids of more than 2 nucleotides and amino acid chains with lengths greater than 7 will be above the 800 dalton cutoff.</obo:REO_0000192>
        <obo:REO_0000192>In the fields of pharmacology and biochemistry, a small molecule is a low molecular weight organic compound which is by definition not a polymer. The term small molecule, especially within the field of pharmacology, is usually restricted to a molecule that also binds with high affinity to a biopolymer such as protein, nucleic acid, or polysaccharide and in addition alters the activity or function of the biopolymer. The upper molecular weight limit for a small molecule is approximately 800 Daltons which allows for the possibility to rapidly diffuse across cell membranes so that they can reach intracellular sites of action. In addition, this molecular weight cutoff is a necessary but insufficient condition for oral bioavailability.

Small molecules can have a variety of biological functions, serving as cell signaling molecules, as tools in molecular biology, as drugs in medicine, as pesticides in farming, and in many other roles. These compounds can be natural (such as secondary metabolites) or artificial (such as antiviral drugs); they may have a beneficial effect against a disease (such as drugs) or may be detrimental (such as teratogens and carcinogens).

Biopolymers such as nucleic acids, proteins, and polysaccharides (such as starch or cellulose) are not small molecules, although their constituent monomers — ribo- or deoxyribonucleotides, amino acids, and monosaccharides, respectively — are often considered to be. Very small oligomers are also usually considered small molecules, such as dinucleotides, peptides such as the antioxidant glutathione, and disaccharides such as sucrose.</obo:REO_0000192>

        <obo:REO_0000192>HOW DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT PURIFICATION AND DECONTAMINATION ARE &apos;RECIPROCAL&apos; PROCESSES?  
Consequently,  there is no difference in these processes when considered from an agent/intention/objective independent perspective. However, when  considering the objective (what is the specified output and how is it treated - ie what role does it have), I think that that these processes can be distinguished (see below)

Purified or decontaminated materials as outputs of material separations are always what is intended to be used after removal of undesired contaminants.  Note that this can be be some molecular target purified from a biological specimen (e.g. BSA purified from bovine serum), or it can be the biological specimen &apos;purified&apos; of some molecular contaminant (e.g. bovine serum decontaminated of BSA).

If the specified output IS TO BE TREATED AS contextually isolated, new entities (ie they were not an input to the process), then the process is a &apos;purification&apos; and the outputs are &apos;purified materials&apos; (because in either case above, the output contains, as the OBI definition says: &quot;higher concentration of a desired component, while others contain impurities and are not of interest&quot;).  

By contrast, if the specified output IS TO BE TREATED AS a modified version of the input material (ie the specified output existed prior to the process as an input material), then the process is a &apos;decontamination&apos; and the outputs are &apos;decontaminated materials&apos;.

So all contextual material component separations would then have a reciprocal physical material component separation – even things like selection and collection – although these cases are not relevant for investigations because the target of separation and target of collection are never important, specified outputs - it is always the separated material that is the specified output.</obo:REO_0000192>
        <obo:REO_0000192>3-26-12: Note that if we are going to classify this as a contextual component separation objective, we need the definition to be clear that this is :

a material component separation objective to obtain only some specified component(s) through separation/removal from some larger target of material separation.
--------
Alternatively,  we could reserve such a definition for extraction, and not assign any contextual vs physical weight to &apos;material purification objective&apos;.  In this case, the purification objective would live as a child of material component separation, and keep the definition given by OBI (below).  This would mean that purifiction could refer both to extractions (ie &apos;protein purification&apos; from a bacterial lysate), or decontaminations (ie &apos;drinking water purification&apos; by removal of dangerous contaminants)

The objective to separate a material entity into different compositions of which one or more have are purified fractions that contain higher concentration of a desired component, while others contain impurities and are not of interest

------------------

I would prefer the former, which leaves the problem of how to distingush purification from extraction (curretly, the OBI defs of both sound the same) . . . perhpas we make purification a child of extraction, where additional steps are taken to achive greater purity of a specific compoennt or component (ie colum chromatography, phase partitioning, precipitations, etc).

The other issue is how to be sure users dont use the purification class when annotating processes such as drinking water purification.</obo:REO_0000192>

        <obo:REO_0000208>Molecular label role has four asserted subclasses, distinguished along two axes : (a) the nature of their association with a molecular target (covalent vs. non-covalent), and (b) their ability to emit or produce some detectable signal : 

1. &apos;molecular reporter role&apos;, inhereing in a &apos;molecular reporter&apos; that  emits some detectable signal and is incorporated covalently into a probe or analyte.  Examples include a radioactive P33 atom incorporated into an aligonucleotide probe, a fluorochrome covalently linked to an antibody probe, a GFP tag linked to a recombinant protein, a radioactive S35 atom incorporated into methionine residues of a protein

2. a &apos;molecular probe role&apos;, inhereing in a &apos;molecular probe&apos; that non-covalently binds a molecular target and links an analyte with a reporter).  Examples include an oligonucleotide probe used to target its complementary sequence in a FISH assay, and antibody used to target a specific protein in a immunhohistochemical assay.

3. A &apos;stain role&apos;, inhereing in a molecular stain or dye, that non-covalently binds to an analyte and emits a detectable colorimetric or fluorescent signal.  Examples include toluidine blue (a blue stain that that targets heparin to detect mast cells in histochemistry), DAPI stain (binds to DNA and fluoresces under UV light), and Ponceau S stain (a red stain which binds generally to protein).

4. a &apos;tracker&apos; role, inhereing in a moleculr tracker that covalently binds to an analyte or probe, and does not emit a detectable signal.  Examples include biotin incorporated into a oligonucleotide probe, or a FLAG epitope tag incorporated into a recombinant protein.</obo:REO_0000208>
        <obo:REO_0000208>OBI (Regarding the label-related roles realilzed in an analyte assay, OBI and ReO seem to agree on the existence of three types of roles.   According to the following example of usage in OBI for the label role :

&apos;Nucleotides synthesized with the incorporation of biotin were used to synthesize cDNA, which was then detected by adding fluorochrome-conjugated anti-biotin antibody.  the fluorochrome bears label role, the antibody bears detector role, the biotin bears reporter role.&apos;

we make the following conclusions:

1. what OBI calls a &apos;label role&apos; (&apos;tracer role&apos;),  ReO calls a &apos;molecular reporter role&apos;.
2. what OBI calls a &apos;detector role&apos;, ReO calls a &apos;molecular probe role&apos;
3. what OBI calls a &apos;reporter role&apos;, ReO calls a &apos;molecular label role&apos; (ie a molecular label role that is not a reporter or probe role)

Notably, at present (9-30-11) no OBI probe role classes exist, OBI:detector reagent is not clearly defined, and OBI seems content not to model distincitons between reporters and probes.

Also, there is still some dissent as to whether a label role is realized in a labeling process, when a labeled material is generated, or in an analyte assay, when the label is dtected and measured.  Once this is decided, axioms shoul dbe added to the label classes indicating the processes through which they are realized.

Finally, the modeling in ReO seems consistent with usage of these concepts/terms in the domain of melecualr and cell biology, but their usage in genomics/array realted work should be verified.  As noted in OBI and in tracker items, use of terms such as &apos;detector&apos; and &apos;probe&apos; may be different in these communities.</obo:REO_0000208>

(note that not all things taht have part some molecular lebel are labeled material either - e.g. things not intentionally containing biotin reagent as a part?)

We could simplify this to just way specified output of a molecular labeling technique (with the assumption that the SPECIFIED outputs of such a technique are only those materials that were successfully labeled) . . . but some OBI folks have indicated the desire to have even non-lableed outputs of a labeling technique be considered to be labeled mateiral.  Ultimately, more discussion is needed here, and perhaps the creation of two classes (one for each of the desired meanins above).

The implications of these two approaches for classification of instance data are significant, in that one requires an instance to be recorded only to satisfy that it is the output of a molecular labeling technique,a dn in the otherit would need to be recorded that it is output of a lableing technique and has_proper_part some molecular label. </obo:REO_0000795>

REFLEXIVITY MEANS THAT THE PART_OF PROPERTY CAN SIMPLY BE READ AS &apos;IS_A OR PART_OF&apos;, AND SHOULD BE USED ONLY IN CASES WHERE THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY.

Example 1: to define &apos;chemical reagent&apos;, we need say that this class either is not or does not have a part that is a bearer of  some concretization of some genetic sequence.  If has_part is not reflexive (or if we use has_proper_part), we have to say this as:

     (not (bears_concretization_of some &apos;genetic sequence region&apos;))
     and (not (has_part some (&apos;bears_concretization_of some
      &apos;genetic sequence region&apos;)))

with has_part being reflexive, we can simply say this as:

      (not (has_part some (&apos;bears_concretization_of some
      &apos;genetic sequence region&apos;)))


Example 2: to describe a carbohydrate array, we want to say that it is an array that is spotted with molecules that either are or have parts that are carbohydrates (and that these entities bear an independent variable role, ie are what an independent variable specification is about).  With has part being reflexive, we can simply say that a carb array:

     &apos;has_proper_part some (&apos;molecular entity&apos; and (has_part some
      (carbohydrate and (&apos;has role&apos; some (&apos;independent variable role&apos;)))))&apos;

&apos;molecular entity&apos;

becasue i defined the following property chains to allow for this:

has_part o bears_concretization_of -&gt; bears concretization of 
and
has_part o bearer_of o concretizes -&gt; bears_concretization_of

but for some reason this creates the issue that organic chemical reagent does not classify as a chemical reagent - even though it looks like it should

note also that we made has_part a reflexive property, such that we do not need to assert both that chemical reagents not (&apos;bearer_of some . . .)  AND not (has_part some (bearer_of some . . . )</obo:REO_0000787>
        <obo:REO_0000787>Note that the label here is potentially problematic, as the term &apos;chemical&apos; is used elsewhere (in the ChEBI class &apos;chemical entity&apos;) to reference any material existing at chemical/molecular scale, whereas here it referes only to non-information molecules.

has_part o bears_concretization_of -&gt; bears concretization of

        <obo:REO_0000192>1. For now only model a high level structure to house chemical reagents, If we decide to populate downward with more specific examples of chemical reagents, this can be done on a case by case basis manually, or we mine ChEBI for all classes that have an &apos;application role&apos; consistent with being a reagent in the ReO sense (inhibitor role, drug role, dye role, etc).  We  can also talk with the ChEBI people about their semi-automated text mining tools/approach for assigning roles to chemical entities based on assertions in the literature.  Their tools/algorithms could conceivable be used to mine the literature and/or vendor catalogs and assign reagent roles to those chemical entities that appear in some pre-defined context in these resources that would suggest them to be reagents.  Refer back to Janna Hastings ICBO 2011 talk for more on this approach. 

2.

Alternatively, we could make a property chain that states has_part o bears_concretization_of -&gt; bears_concretization_of, and then keep the logical def of chemical reagent as &apos;molecular entity and (not (bears_concretization_of some &apos;genetic sequence region&apos;)) and (has_role some reagent role) . . . however, when i try this things dont classify right for some reason (organic chemical reagent in particular)</obo:REO_0000192>

        <obo:REO_0000192>Analog is a function because by our definition all analogs are manufactured molecules that are made for a particular purpose (ie to mimic some natural molecule).  All &apos;molecular analog reagents&apos; additionally have a reagent role which exploits the analog function of the molecular analog toward the goal of gathering information about some other entity of interest.

Note that another approach is not to require that analogs are manufactured, and not to require that they be unnatural - it is conceivable that some naturally occuring amino acid, for ex, could posses some quality that allows it to be used as an analog in some process.  We do not take this approach, however, as we construe analogs to be created with the intent of mimicking some natural target.

If we decide to make analog a reagent role, use the obsoleted class : obsolete_analog reagent role

Note also that according to this definition, many molecular labels are analogs (e.g. conjugated antibodies or oligos that contain some reporter entity) However, molecular label role is not a subtype of analog role, because not all labels are analogs.</obo:REO_0000192>

-----
Note here that a experimental modification process need not always output some modified version of some input.  Rather, this could be some de novo synthesis of a chemical that is INTENDED to represent some modified version of some specified reference chemical. 

This is because we want to use the term &apos;experimentally modified&apos; to refer to any structurally altered version of some specified object, whether it results from a process where unmodified version is input and modified version is output (ie is derived from the reference object), or where the modified version of the reference object is produced de novo, for ex through chemical synthesis.  So, to be able to have classes such as &apos;experimentally modified cell&apos; or &apos;experimentally modified amino acid&apos; that cover both possibilities above, we need to be sure that &apos;material modification objective&apos; is defined accordingly, as this objective will be used to define an experimental modification technique which is used to define any experimentally modified material (ie the material is output of a exp mod technique, which in turn has a material mod obj.)  

e.g. de novo synthesis of a modified amino acid such as phospho-serine need not have serine as input, or even as a reaction intermediate during the chemical synthesis. The important part is that there is some specified reference object (serine) that an agent intends to create a structurally modified version of through the material modification process.

e.g. many amino acid analogs are considered to be modified version of some natural amino acid (their reference object), but they are not derived from this natural, reference amino acid.  Rather, they are syntehsized de novo or from some other form of chemical synthesis.

So, perhaps better to call this a modified-material production process?</obo:REO_0000208>

        <obo:REO_0000192>Need to consider here if invoking a reference material to define experimental modification objective means that all outputs of processes with such an objective would be analogs (ie stand in an is_analog_of relation to the reference material).  I don’t think this is the case, as you would say that phosphorylating a protein or plasmid is a material modification, but the output does not represent an analog.  Being an analog requires additionally that (1) the bearer is not a natural type, and (2) there is some intent to apply the bearer to mimic the reference material in some way.</obo:REO_0000192>
        <obo:REO_0000208>Now want to use this class to refer to output of a process where unmodified version is input and modified version is output 
-----
Note that the key difference here from &apos;material modification objective&apos; is that there exists some specified reference material such that it is the objective of some material processing to generate some structurally modified version of this refrence material.  This is not always true of a more general material modification objective, which applies to manufacturing processes where the output is not intended to be a modified version of such a reference material.

This distinction becomes important for modeling &apos;modified&apos; versions of entities such as cells or molecules, which are important types of reagents where we want to be more specific than saying that these reagents are output of some material modification, but rather say that they are output from some material modification that results in a modified version of some reference material according to the researcher&apos;s intentions/specifications.

EXAMPLES
Ligation of several pieces of dsDNA into a plasmid achieves a material modification objective but not a experimental modification objective, while the phosphorylation of the resulting plasmid with some nucleotide kinase does achieve an experimental modification objective.

Establishing a cell culture could be said to achieve BOTH a material modification objective (or more specifically a manufacturing objective), as the cell culture itself is a manufactured output assembled from the processes inputs, as well as an experimental modification objective, as the individual cells that are part of this cell culture represent experimentlaly modified versions of the input cells (ie the reference objects).  Stably transecting these cell culture cells to express some gene of interest, however, achieves only an experimental modification objective (more specifically, a genetic modification objective).</obo:REO_0000208>

Otherwise, they would be a subtype of exp mod amino acid, since we are defining experimentally modified as being output from any material modification technique (which is any non-contextual material processing).  Accordingly, any manufactured amino acid would be experimentally modified - and since we are saying that all analogs are manufactured, (ie they are &apos;designed, and bear an artifactual function &gt; molecular analog function) then they should all be experimentally modified.

Of course, the counterargument is that a naturally occurring amino acid would be used as an analog, as analogs are defined only by a role they bear, and some agent could desire to use a natural amino acid as an analog.  But as we define things now, analog roles exploit analog functions, which are artifactual functions requiring manufacture of the bearer by some agent.

The reagent role is:

(1) GAINED by virtue of its bearer being intended as input into either (a) an assay, where it contributes to the detection, measurement, or examination of some other substance or process, or (b) a material processing technique aimed at producing some other material, which is typically to be used in such an assay.  In ReO, we model this by indicating that the reagent role is &apos;gained through&apos; an intentional process (planning) that has a &apos;reagent specification&apos; as an output.  

(2) REALIZABLE only through its bearer participating in (or having parts that participate in) some chemical interaction during the execution of some assay or material processing technique, such that(a) in the case of an assay, data is generated about some entity other than the bearer, and (b) in the case of a material processing technique, the specified output does not share identity with the bearer.</obo:REO_0000208>
        <obo:REO_0000192>5-21-12  A note about reagent subroles:

If we make molecular label role and buffer roles subtypes of the reagent role, then all molecular label and buffer classes we make will necessarily be reagents.  this means that we will not have classes representing a molecular label that is not a reagent (ie used in an assay to test the efficacy of the label), or a buffer that is not a reagent (ie used in an assay to see how much buffer needs to be added to a solution to get a desired pH level).

In the former case of the molecular label, this is perfectly OK, because the label role is defined as necessarily being used to reveal the presence of some target - and in this application a reagent role must be realized (ie it represents a constraining of the conditions of a reagent role) In the case where an assay tests the efficacy of the some cy5 stain, the cy5 is not serving as a label because it is not being used to reveal the presence of some target.  So for ReO and OBI, a molecular label is always a reagent, but cy5 is not always a molecular label.

In the latter case of a buffer, if ReO and OBI want to consider cases where a buffer role is realized in an process to see how much buffer needs to be added to a solution to get a desired pH level as within their scope, then we should not make buffer role a child of reagent role.  But such cases seem rare and less interesting, a and thus perhaps not in scope of OBI?  In the vast majority of (interesting/relevant) cases, a buffer role is always realized in a technique where it is used as a reagent, to stabilize the pH of a solution to study some other entity or produce some distinct output material.  

So the key question to ask when thinking about subclassing the reagent role is, is the subrole ALWAYS realized in a process where the bearer is used as a reagent (ie does the role represent a constraining of the reagent role), or are there cases within our scope that the role would be realized where the bearer is not used as a reagent.</obo:REO_0000192>
        <obo:REO_0000208>(Obsolete becasue we seem now to want to interpret bearing a reagent role to not specifically require an agents intent to apply in a specific technique)

A reagent is a processed material entity bearing a reagent role.  This role is GAINED upon the intention of some agent to apply a processed material in a scientific technique in a manner consistent with the reagent definition above (and REALIZED through its actual participation in this technique). Often the gaining of the reagent role is co-incident with the initial production or subsequent processing/extraction of the material for use in an experiment (e.g. synthesis of synthetic oligos or extraction some natural product with the intent to apply as a reagent) . But this role can also be gained subsequent to the creation/processing of a material bearer, for example when a researcher is actually planning an experiment and decides to use it as a reagent. </obo:REO_0000208>
        <obo:REO_0000795>NOTES REGARDING OUR INTERPRETATION OF REAGENT ROLE/REAGENT-NESS

A. 
There are three different situations/stages of reagent-ness in regards to the reagent role: 
   1. Having the capability to be applied as a reagent (according to some conventions of historical use)
   2. Actually being the subject of some agents intent to be applied as a reagent in a planned technique
   3. Realizing a reagent role by participating in the specified technique
 
We consider 1 and 3 to be the most interesting and important to represent - and so we interpret the bearing and realization of a reagent role to signify 1 and 3, respectively. So when we say that a material bears a reagent role, it should be construed as ‘it can be/is conventionally used as a reagent in some capacity’. When we say that a technique realizes a reagent role inhering in some material, this indicates that the material was actually applied as a reagent, according to the definition of the reagent role. Again, we see these as the two most important cases. The remaining case (#2 above) is hardest to pin down because it results from a cognitive intention whose application toward a given class or instance of a material is hard to know for certain - thus posing significant modeling issues.

One possibility for representing all three cases is to use a &apos;bearing of a reagent disposition&apos; for case 1, &apos;bearing of a reagent role&apos; for case 2, and &apos;realizing a reagent role or disposition&apos; for case 3 . . . but it is not clear that dispositions can inhere in materials based on a &apos;conventional application&apos;.  Perha[ sjsut use &apos;specifically dependent continuant . . or create a new subtype called &apos;application&apos; or &apos;capability&apos;?  (See SIO:capability)

B.
Look at how the SIO uses the &apos;capability&apos; realizable entity, or their conception of roles - could something like this better capture what we see as being a reagent (ie is capable of being used in a certain way?)

Note their &apos;reagent role&apos; is defined fairly loosely - and similar to ReO reagent role : &apos;a role of a chemical substance that participates in a chemical reaction as part of some scientific investigation.&apos; (but too loose becasue not all chemicals participating in a reaction in an investigation are reagents - some are study subjects/specimens under investigation - but perhaps SIO considers these to actually be reagents?  Note also that their reagent role inheres in a &apos;chemical sustance -  &apos;loosely connected chemical entities&apos; -  which includes things like cell lines, organisms, antibodies, etc

C. Consider the implicaitons of the axiom that this role is realized in a chemical reaction that is part of a technique . . .and see annotation on this axiom for more here.

D. Regarding the exploratory superclass axiom: I think this is OK, because proper_part_of is transitive, so if a technique is realized by some chemical reaction that is part of some biological process that is part of some technique, we are fine.  And becasue of the open world assumption, if we way that a reagent role is realized by some technique, or biological process that is part of some technique, then we are OK too (becasue there is nothing that says that a chemical reaction is not part of the technique or biological process? still, may want to avoid tyring to define/describe reagents or the reagent role with axioms, and leave this to the textual definition</obo:REO_0000795>
        <obo:REO_0000192>attempt at informative superclass axiom:

&apos;is realized by&apos; some

(technique and (has_specified_output some (&apos;is bearer of&apos; some  Self ))))))) . . . but this seemed to cause inconsisent reasoning (for transfection classes)

In this complex superclass axiom - I am testing use of &apos;local reflexivity&apos; using the &apos;Self&apos; constructor to logically describe fact that reagent roles are realized in (1) investigations where the CONCLUSIONS are about some entity distinct from the bearer of the reagent role, or (2) techniques where the  material output has an identity distinct from the bearer of the reagent role</obo:REO_0000192>

a role inhering in a material entity intended to be input into an assay where it participates in some chemical interaction to facilitate the generation of data about some other material serving as an evaluant, or a material processing technique where it participates in a chemical interaction to facilitate the generation of some specified output to which it does not contribute significant material.

Note that this is an older def (v1) - preceding consideration of the &apos;immediately consumed or altered&apos; approach that was meant to include non-molecular reagents but exclude things like gel box wires (v2), and pre-new approach that says it is ok to consider a gel box wire a reagent (v3).

a role inhering in a processed material that is gained through a planning process which specifies its intended use as input into some technique, in which it will participate in some chemical reaction as part of either (1) an assay in which data is not generated about the bearer; or (2) a material processing technique in which the specified output does not derive from the bearer of the reagent role (ie the bearer does not contribute significant material to the composition of the specified output).  The reagent role is realized through the bearer&apos;s participation in such a process.

or

        <obo:REO_0000208>Note that even in the same technique (e.g. addition of a fluorescent labeled antibody to an ELISA plate to measure binding to some fixed protein), the identity of the evaluant and the reagent(s) are in the eye of the experimentalist.  For instance, if the goal of the assay is to confirm that the antibody probe works by comparing binding to positive and negative control proteins on the ELISA, then the antibody is the evaluant and the proteins on the ELISA plate are the reagents.  If the goal of the assay is to identify a protein target from some panel of samples using a known/validated fluorochrome-linked antibody probe, then the antibody probe and fluorocrome are reagents, and the protein samples on the ELISA plate are the evaluants.</obo:REO_0000208>
        <obo:REO_0000208>obsolete becaue replaced by updated version: Reagents are distinguished from instruments or devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents necessarily particpate in or have parts that participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during their intended participation in some technique.  By contrast, instruments od not participate in a chemical reaction/interaction during the technique.

Reagents are distinguished from evaluants in that evaluants are that about which data is generated in an assay, while reagents, by definition, are not.  It should be noted, however, that these roles can be borne by separate instances of the same type of material entity - but each instance can only realize one of these riles in a given instance of an assay. For example, taq polymerase can bear a reagent role or an evaluant role: In a DNA sequencing assay aimed at generating sequence data about some plasmid, the reagent role of the taq polymerase is realized. By contrast, in an assay to evaluate the quality of the taq polymerase itself, the evaluant role of the taq is realized, but not the reagent role since the taq is the subject about which data is generated.</obo:REO_0000208>

        <obo:REO_0000192>The ReO definition of reagenent is quite broad and inclusive, compared to the more traditional definition of &apos;reagent&apos; coming from the field of chemistry (which is seen in the OBI:reagent role).  For this reason, we may want to include an OBO Foundry Unique label for REO:reagent and REO:reagent role that clarifies this - something like &apos;biomedical reagent&apos; or  &apos;biomedical research reagent&apos;?</obo:REO_0000192>
        <obo:REO_0000208>(replaced by updated comment to reflect new conception)

A reagent is a material entity bearing a reagent role.  This role is : 

(1) GAINED by virtue of its bearer being intended as input into either (a) an assay, where it contributes to the detection, measurement, or examination of some other substance or process, or (b) a material processing technique aimed at producing some other material, which is typically to be used in such an assay.  In ReO, we model this by indicating that the reagent role is &apos;gained through&apos; an intentional process (planning) that has a &apos;reagent specification&apos; as an output.  

(2) REALIZABLE only through its bearer participating in (or having parts that participate in) some chemical interaction during the execution of some assay or material processing technique, such that(a) in the case of an assay, data is generated about some entity other than the bearer, and (b) in the case of a material processing technique, the specified output does not share identity with the bearer.

Reagents are therefore distinguished from instruments or devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents necessarily particpate in or have parts that participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during their intended participation in some technique.  By contrast, instruments od not participate in a chemical reaction/interaction during the technique.

Reagents are distinguished from study subjects and evaluants in that study subjects and evaluants are that about which data is generated in an assay, while reagents, by definition, are not.  It should be noted, however, that these roles can be borne by separate instances of the same type of material entity - but each instance can only realize one of these riles in a given instance of an assay. For example, taq polymerase can bear a reagent role or an evaluant role.  In a DNA sequencing assay aimed at generating sequence data about some plasmid, the reagent role of the taq polymerase is realized. In an assay to evaluate the quality of the taq polymerase itself, the evaluant role of the taq is realized, but not the reagent role since the taq is the subject about which data is generated.</obo:REO_0000208>
        <obo:REO_0000795>See superclass axioms below: Dont think these are right because the Self construct does not always refer the the class on which the axiom is placed, but rather is &apos;locally defined&apos; in the class description itself - so is about the investigation in how these are written below.

        <obo:REO_0000192>We no longer require that the material processing achieves a &apos;reagent creation objective&apos;, because often a material is processed for some other (non-reagent) purpose, and it is only later that some agent decides to use it as a reagent and in so doing it gains the reagent role.  In these cases, the reagent role is gained purely through a mental act/ intention</obo:REO_0000192>
        <obo:REO_0000208>(this comment was obsoleted because we now allow/advocate reagent role subclassing when it is warranted - ie when a reagent class is defined by bearing a role that is a refinement of the reagent role itself, and cannot be defined by any common disposition, funciton, process, etc borne or participated in by the instances of the class)

design pattern for creating reagent equivalent classes is NOT to simply create a reagent role subtype corresponding to the desired eq class (e.g. reagent role&gt;molecular label role, or reagent role&gt;primer role).

This is becasue these things are not REALLY defined by bearing some subtype of the reagent roles - rather, these eq classes defined by their members bearing a reagent role AND sharing some physical characteristic (ie a dependent continuant  - a function or disposition) or an additional role -  that is exploited in a specified way during a technique in which the reagent role of the bearer is also realized.

So, when defining reagent eq classes, assign a reagent role and then use axioms to logically describe these additional qualities/realizable entities shared by all class members that allow them to serve some purpose in a given technque, and also, if applicable/possible, the type of process through which the reagent role is realized.

(Alt, if you dont want to/cannot create a disposition or function for defining the eq class, link the reagent role assigned to the class with a specific type of technique through which it is realized - as long as it unique identifies (ie is necc and suff for defining) the desired eq class)

Example : a fluorescent reporter is a molecular entity that bears a reagent role that is realized in a detection of label process, and its &apos;labelness&apos; is contingent upon it bearing a &apos;fluorescence&apos; disposition.

Example :  primer reagent is a ss nucleic acid that bears a reagent role that is realized in the process of nucleic acid synthesis, and dependent upon its disposition to bind ss nucleic acids.</obo:REO_0000208>
        <obo:REO_0000192>IF WE DECIDE TO ACCOMODATE THINGS LIKE, MODEL ORGANISMS AND CELL LINES AS REAGENTS (WHICH ARE OFTEN USED AS STUDY SUBJECTS IN ASSAYS AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT QUALIFY AS REAGENTS IN THESE CASES), WE MAY JUST WANT TO CREATE A VERY GENERAL STATEMENT ABOUT HOW REO VIEWS REAGENTS:
	
&quot;Biomedical research ultimately aims to understand the natural biological world.  Artifacts such as REAGENTS and SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS are created to study attributes of this biological world, either through processing/co-opting some natural material (e.g. isolating BSA to serve as a blocking agent in a W Blot), or engineering a new manufactured material entity (e.g. a cell line or model organism).  In this view, inputs into biomedical investigations can play several &apos;experimental roles&apos;:

1. &apos;study subject&apos; - a  material entity about which data is produced in an investigation (this entity can additional be a biological specimen or even a reagent in the case of a cell line or model organism)
	
1a. &apos;(animate) study subject&apos; - a living organism or model system that is the subject of study in an investigation (e.g. a human clinical trial subject, a population of baboons studied in the wild, a transgenic mouse in a toxigogenomics study, a cell line in a drug screen)

1b. &apos;evaluant&apos; - an inanimate object that is the subject of study in an iinvestigation, and which typically has as part some analyte that is measured in an assay.
	
2. &apos;biological specimen&apos; - an inanimate, material once &apos;part of&apos; a biological entity (ie are &apos;ex vivo&apos;),  isolated for use in an investigation as an example of its kind (e.g. a tissue section, isolated WBCs, a whole organism prep). Biological specimens often also serve as study subjects in an assay or investigation.
	
3. &apos;reagent&apos; - materials processed or manufactured to facilitate study of the natural world, by participating i (or having integral parts that participate in) some chemical interaction during an assay or technique (e.g. a buffer, an antibody, a chemical inhibitor, a cell line)
	
4. &apos;scientific instrument&apos; - processed materials created to serve a specified function, and applied in an investigation to study the natural world without participating in a chemical reaction as part of an assay or technique (e.g. a microscope, a scale balance, a test tube).
	
Here, reagents will include things like cell lines and model organisms, since these are not naturally-occurring (ie were manufactured according to some plan specification), not  &apos;ex vivo&apos; (were never part of some naturally occurring organism), and have integral parts whose participation in an assay or technique is essential to realizing their experimental role.
	
Question - how about genetically engineered mice used in a water maze assay?  are these live research subjects (they are not naturally-occurring), or reagents (there is no probing of a chemical attribute)?</obo:REO_0000192>

ACTUALLY, IT DOES :  but the converse is not true - ie that a research material can be defined as being output of a material processing techninque)

All material processings that are techniques should be asserted under material processing technique, and inferred to be material processing techniques based on having an output that is a processed material that has a research material role.  NO - instead I will assert material processing techniques under material processing technique, and say that a material processing technique has output only some research material.  then I could say that a research material is anything that has a research material role or is output of a material processing technique.  As a result, i would not have to worry about developers having to indicate axiomatically that material processings with an output that is a research material &apos;has_specified_output some (has_role some &apos;research material role&apos;))&apos;  (and I could remove all such existing axioms) . . . which seems more convenient.  The burden then is on developers to be sure to assert material processings that have research material outputs as material processing techniques (which should be easy, as nearly all material processings in OBi and ReO are techniques.  

With this new approach, things will be inferred to be a research material based on their being output from a material processing technique, instead of the reverse (things being inferred to be techniques based on their having a outputs that have a research material role.  I think this is more useful and intuitive to expect developers to model and users to understand.

What implicaitons would this new approach have if I decide to elim the material processing technique class and jsut use OBI material processing . . .then I would have a situation where a research material is defined as being output of a material processing - which is not correct.

Notes from ChEBI tracker:
The term &apos;modified amino acid&apos; has long given us bother, hence our 
reluctance to include a definition of it in ChEBI.  It might help if I 
recount something about its history.  The term &apos;modified amino acid&apos;  owes its existence within ChEBI to our import of the original Chemical Ontology as devised by Michael Ashbuner in the 1980s.  This was an offshoot of the Gene Ontology in which terms such as &apos;modified amino acid transport&apos; existed (and do still). If I understand it correctly, the original meaning of the term was &apos;naturally occurring amino acid residue modification&apos; but over the years it has been used as a place to put any entity derived from any amino acid, in both ChEBI and the GO.  Of course, a special difficulty arises with the relationship modified amino acid is_a amino acid, as some of the child terms are not acids at all (e.g. some amides are included).It&apos;s an area which we have been intending to attack for a while but one of those which it has been too easy to put off doing anything about.

        <obo:REO_0000795>Clarification is required here (from OBI) as to whether genetically modified requires stable integration (ie the modification is inherited by progeny. OBI seems to hold that this is not required (based on transfection being a genetic transformation that has a genetically modified material as output) . . .  but on the other hand, the definition of genetic transformation cites the alteration or introduction of &apos;genetic material&apos; . . . which is defined in ExpDesign.owl as neccesarrily able to be replicated in the host. . .  .

I would contend that a cell line that has been transiently transfected (ie just had some plasmids thrown into it) would not be genetically modified - because this change is not heritable - so OBI would need to change its modeling of transfection.  

Bottom line is we have to decide if genetic modification requires stable/heritable alteractions, or just a change in the overal expressible genetic content of the cell:

1) a material entity (organism, cell, or cell line) that has been intentionally modified through some genetic modification technique that alters the sequence of its genetic material, or introduces exogenous genetic material that contibutes to some gene expression process in the organism

vs

2) a material entity (organism, cell, or cell line) that has been intentionally modified through some genetic modification technique that alters the sequence of its genetic material, or introduces exogenous genetic material that can be stably replicated and thus be heritable by progeny.

I would lean toward the latter (#2), as this represents a valuable, sharable, replicable resource/reagent, and we can just call the other class &apos;transiently transfected&apos; or &apos;transiently expressing&apos;.  And this is how I have modeled this class in ReO.

a role realized by a planned process in which the bearer is physically modified by some agent, through the addition or removal of material, or the alteration of its internal structure</obo:REO_0000192>

        <obo:REO_0000208>Obsolete because i dont think the following is accurate - specimens are inputs into investigations, but not necessarily the subject of an assay. 

Specimen vs Evaluant Roles Explained: 

Both roles are ultimately realized in a process that generates information about the bearer (ie an investigation or an assay).  That is, specimens and evaluants both bear some agents intent to be studied.  The key difference is that, while an evaluant role is realized only in an assay, a specimen role is realized more broadly in an investigation (or, more precisely, a technique that is part of an investigation, since all &apos;study design execution&apos; steps are techniques).   (Recall that investigations consist of several processual parts, and that study design execution is the part where actual techniques are performed.)  So, this means that a specimen role can be realized in either an assay (like an evaluant), or in a material processing  technique that occurs during an investigation - but only one that generates another specimen (as ultimately the original specimen must bear an intent to be studied in the investigation, if only in virtue of some part of it (derived through some material processing technique) being studied).  

So, to recap: a specimen role is_realized_by some (technique and (part_of some investigation).  An evaluant role is_realized_by only assay.  Not all things that bear a specimen role will end up bearing an evaluant role (only those parts / derivations of the specimen that end up being that which data is generated about in some assay (ie those that end up also bearing an evaluant role)

Example scenario: If I collect an organism from an environment and intend to study it as an example of its type, it has a specimen role.  This  role may be realized directly in an assay about the organism, or in some material processing technique in which another specimen is generated from the original organism specimen (ie its blood is drawn form the organism as a derived/secondary specimen, intended to be studied in some assay is performed with this blood as the evaluant). 

So ultimately a specimen must itself play an evaluant role or some part of it/entity derived from it through a material processing technique must play an evaluant role</obo:REO_0000208>
        <obo:REO_0000192>Here I adopt the OBI axiom: &apos;inheres in&apos; some (material_entity and (is_specified_output_of some &apos;specimen creation&apos;))

because the domain of is_specified_output_of is a planned process, and thus it seems OK to say that a specimen can be a specified output of an intentional specimen creation process such as noting a baboon in the wild which you will track and study</obo:REO_0000192>
        <obo:REO_0000208>Obsoleted &apos;feedback to OBI&apos; annotation:
 (ReO proposes two changes: First is to remove the necessity that a specimen be intended for use in an investigation, as this is very often not the case.  Furthermore, OBI already uses an evaluant role for entities that are intended subjects of an assay, such that the specimen role as defined in OBI seems redundant.  ReO implements the specimen role such that it is gained upon an agent’s intent to collect it instead of upon it’s collection, and is realized upon its collection and not its input in an investigation.  

Second is to change the label of the ‘specimen creation’ class to ‘specimen collection’, as according to our definition, all specimens are outputs of some collection process.  This second change may not be required, however, if we say that specimens can be derived from other specimens, in which case the derivation process that creates a specimen is not a collection process.

If it is determined that specimens can be created in the absence of some collection process, then we can use the ReO:specimen creation class (defined as has_specified_output some specimen) as an equivalent class to subsume the specimen collection process along with other processes that generate specimens.  This would also mean that we cannot say a specimen role is gained in a collection process.)</obo:REO_0000208>

So, ReO needs to decide how it will view chemical reagents, and how the reagent role applies to chemicals:
(1) as individual molecular entities that each bear a reagent role - which makes modeling and integration with ChEBI and other ontologies more straightforward; or 
(2) as &apos;compounds&apos; (compositionally pure collections of molecular entities in a fixed ratio) - such that a molecular entity is a &apos;part_of&apos; some reagent compound, but the reagent role is not borne by a single molecule but by collection of molecules.( this reflects the reality of how chemicals are USED in biomedical research as reagents, but makes modeling and integration/interoperability with other ontologies more challenging)
	
Is a &apos;collection&apos; of molecular entities a molecular entity?  Mixtures, technically, are collections (separable by mechanical/physical means, as opposed to chemical means (ie a chemical reaction is required)</obo:REO_0000192>

        <obo:REO_0000192>Possible that this should be a child of reagent library??  Esp if we end up considering these as collections of reagent role bearing components.

Also, are tissue arrays reagents, or &apos;specimen/evaluant arrays&apos;???  Same question goes for any array in which the immobilized entities on the array are the subjects of the investigation (as opposed to the target material added to the array) . . . in cases where the immobilized entities represent known/characterized/ independent variables, the array is a reagent.  In cases where the immobilized entities are not known/characterized, but are rather the subject of the investigation, the array is not a reagent.  

But it is conceivable that any of the types of arrays mentioned (including tissue and cell arrays) COULD be used as reagents (ie their immobilized content would be the independent variable, not the dependent variable being studied).  So, as with things like proteins or cell lines, we create classes to represent these things.  But for a given instance in an experiment, it may not always be a reagent.  This may be a case for further broadening our notion of reagents, or broadening our scope in ReO to cover research materials</obo:REO_0000192>

2. For non-molecular reagents, however,  particularly to rule out tricky cases such as electrode probes/leads, there should be this requirement for &apos;immediate consumption or inactivation&apos;.

3. What about cell lines - as non-molecular reagetns, are consumed or inactivated when used as reagents?  
  - In case where they produce cellular products . . .  YES, their molecular parts are immediately consumed and they are not reusable after this without further processing.

2. If the reagent was considered to be the collection of antibodies in a tube (as ERO has done), then we could say that the difference between monoclonal and polyclonal was that the former has_grain only one type of molecule, vs the latter consisting of many different types of antibodies.  The problem here for ReO then becomes asserting this as a molecular entity (ERO does not have this problem because it just asserts all reagents as reagents, rather than asserting according to their natural type and then inferring to be reagents) . . .  ERO can define a monoclonal antibody as &apos;an antibody reagent that recognizes a single epitope&apos;, because they consider them as the tube of reagents - obviously any molecular antibody reagent (at a single molecule level) would recognize only a single epitope be it mono- or poly- clonal.

Polyclonal antibodies (or antisera) are antibodies that are derived from different B cell lines. They are a mixture of immunoglobulin molecules secreted against a specific antigen, each recognizing a different epitope. These antibodies are typically produced by immunization of a suitable mammal, such as a mouse, rabbit or goat. Larger mammals (like horses) are often preferred as the amount of serum that can be collected is greater. An antigen is injected into the mammal. This induces the B-lymphocytes to produce IgG immunoglobulins specific for the antigen. This polyclonal IgG is polyclonal purified from the mammal’s serum (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyclonal_antibodies)</obo:REO_0000208>

        <obo:REO_0000208>Obsolete - becasue we now allow for the support substrate to be part of the microarray

In ReO we consider the microarray to consist of a collection of molecular aggregates.  The microarray support substrate is akin to &apos;packaging&apos; that orders these components for an assay, and is not part of the microarray reagent.  A microarray quadrant is part of a microarray support substrate that consists of a demarcated portion of the solid substrate, onto which some uniform collection of molecular entities is spotted.  It is the total colleciton of all of these spotted colelctions of molecules that represents the microarray reagent. 

Regarding alignment with OBI, one issue is that OBI seems to think of the microarray as the support matrix + probes, while ReO (and ERO?) think of it as a collection of probe reagents where the solid support is not included - ie is akin to the packaging because we are really concerned with the probes . . . although in this case the support matrix does provide an important experimental function, realized in the experiment, of organizing and separating the individual probesets).

PERHAPS IMPORT OBI CLASS AS &apos;MICROARRAY DEVICE&apos; - WHICH HAS A S PART THE MICROARRAY PROBE COLLECTIONA ND THE MICROARRAY SOLID SUPPORT MATRIX.  AGAIN, THIS SEEMS TO BE A LABLEING ISSUE - THERE ARE CLEARLY THREE &apos;CONCEPTS WE WANT TO REPRESENT - JUST NEED TO DECIDE ON THE BEST NAMES FOR THEM&apos;, AND WHICH IS A REAGENTS AND WHICH IS A DEVICE</obo:REO_0000208>

Devices and reagents are disjoint in ReO, so we should not use this if OBI considers it a device (with a solid support function). It is also possible that OBI:microarray refers specifically to molecular microarrays, and not tissue microarrays. 

2. Possible that this should be a child of reagent library??  Esp if we end up considering these as collections of reagent role bearing components.  Would be correct if do not consider the solid support matrix a part of the reagent.

For now will say that it is any amino acid functionally derived from another amino acid - such that it includes all amino acids excpet some undefined foundational set of &apos;unmodified&apos; amino acids.  We acknowledge this definition is problematic, and will work with ChEBI and others to address it in the near future.

Notes from ChEBI tracker:
The term &apos;modified amino acid&apos; has long given us bother, hence our 
reluctance to include a definition of it in ChEBI.  It might help if I 
recount something about its history.  The term &apos;modified amino acid&apos;  owes its existence within ChEBI to our import of the original Chemical Ontology as devised by Michael Ashbuner in the 1980s.  This was an offshoot of the Gene Ontology in which terms such as &apos;modified amino acid transport&apos; existed (and do still). If I understand it correctly, the original meaning of the term was &apos;naturally occurring amino acid residue modification&apos; but over the years it has been used as a place to put any entity derived from any amino acid, in both ChEBI and the GO.  Of course, a special difficulty arises with the relationship modified amino acid is_a amino acid, as some of the child terms are not acids at all (e.g. some amides are included).It&apos;s an area which we have been intending to attack for a while but one of those which it has been too easy to put off doing anything about.  But your query is prompting us into action, so please bear with us while the curators sort out how best to sort out the mess.</obo:REO_0000795>
        <obo:REO_0000208>Note that modified amino acids can be synthesized de novo, such that there is not necessarily some experimental modification process that takes as input some unmodified amino acid and outputs a modified variant.  However, these are always output form some experimental modification process, as any synhtetic process would be considered an experimental modification.

So if ReO and OBI want to consider cases where a buffer role is realized in an process to see how much buffer needs to be added to a solution to get a desired pH level as within their scope, then we should not make buffer role a child of reagent role.  But such cases seem rare and less interesting, and thus perhaps not in scope of OBI?  In the vast majority of (interesting/relevant) cases, a buffer role is always realized in a technique where it is used as a reagent, to stabilize the pH of a solution to study some other entity or produce some distinct output material.

The disposition is used to define molecular entities that are buffers, becasue we want to allow for any such moelcules to be considered buffers if they physically are able to buffer.  By contrast, the much stronger &apos;buffer role&apos; is used to define &apos;buffer solutions&apos; (as being made using a chemical that has a &apos;buffer role&apos;) - because it may be the case that a solution contains some chemical that bears a buffering disposition, but this disposition is not exploited experimentally (ie the chemical is not used to buffer the solution) . . . and in these cases, we do not necessarily have a buffer solution.</obo:REO_0000808>

        <obo:REO_0000192>Concepts of inverse processes/objectives and reciprocal processes/objectives is useful in understanding our approach to classification of material proceeings/objectives.

INVERSE def = an element that, when combined with a given element in an operation, produces the identity element for that operation. So paired material combinations and separations are INVERSE, because  combining and then separating gives back the original input

RECIPROCAL def = a mathematical expression or function so related to another that their product is one; the quantity obtained by dividing the number one by a given quantit. So paired contextual separations and physical separations are RECIPROCAL, because combining the specified outputs of these objectives for the same process gives the whole (ie 1).

All contextual processings (except portioning/aliquoting?) have a reciprocal physical processing – even things like selection and collection – although these cases are not relevant for investigations because the target of separation and target of collection are never important, specified outputs.

        <obo:REO_0000192>Summary of how polypeptide/protein classes are treated in ChEBI, PRO, and GO:

Import &apos;amino acid chain&apos; from PRO, but use a ReO specific label of &apos;peptide&apos;.  ChEBI peptide (&apos;an amide derived from two or more amino carboxylic acid molecules (the same or different) by formation of a covalent bond from the carbonyl carbon of one to the nitrogen atom of another with formal loss of water&apos;) may be synonymous with PRO:amino acid chain.

Note that this PRO:amino acid chain class is different than ChEBI: polypeptide, which is defined as &gt; 10 aa&apos;s.  As we do not want size considerations in our class, we use the PRO class here, which has no size considerations in its definition.  

Note also that ChEBI:polypeptide has a subclass &apos;protein polypeptide chain&apos; defined as synth at the ribosome, and has axiom that it has part some canonical aa residue.  &apos;Protein&apos; in ChEBI is defined as minimally having part some protein polypeptide chain . . . and in wikipedia it is said that proteins can consist of more than one polypeptide chain.   PRO, however, seems to say that proteins are single polypeptide chains produced by the ribosome . . . so may want to re-use the PRO:protein class here, and define it accordingly.

Finally, from Bada/Hunter paper : &apos;In ChEBI, protein polypeptide chain is a child of polypeptide, but in the SO, the term polypeptide seems to be synonymous with CHEBI:protein polypeptide chain. (The comment for SO:polypeptide states that it has been merged with “protein”, and “protein” is an exact synonym.) To make things more difficult, ChEBI also has a term named protein, which seems to encompass both single protein chains (corresponding to CHEBI:protein polypeptide chain, SO:polypeptide, and presumably to PRO:protein) and also protein complexes (corresponding to GO:protein complex).&apos;</obo:REO_0000192>

        <obo:REO_0000192>ISSUE: Unclear if this should be a child of material component separation: are processes such as  collecting a turtle as a specimen from a pond a material separation (it could be if you consider the whole environment a unit, and consider that the turtle was separated from this environment . . .  and according to the OBI def of material separation objective, (is an objective to transform a material entity into spatially separated components), this may be correct, as material entity is sufficiently broad to cover things like environments/habitats.  

PROPOSED SOLUTION: Recall that in OBI, planned processes are defined by their objectives, and not simply on the nature of their inputs and outputs. So materail collection SHOULD be considered a material component separation, because from the perspective of the specified output (ie the collected material), this output was separated from its previous environment, and this separation is integral to  the OBJECTIVE of the planned process)

In addition, most collections are clearly material separations, so it may be easiest to model this way (with collection as a child of separation . . . or assert most collections as children of separation and add an axiom has objective some collection objective to have it classify as a defined &apos;material collection process&apos; class.  This seems like it would be most compatible with OBI, where most collection processes have separation objective axioms and thus appear as types of separations.)

Despite the above, this classification may intuitively seem wrong . . . again, may be an issue of granularity where we can say that at an environment/collection granularity, this is a material separation, but at a macroscopic/anatomical level of granularity, it is not.)  

Note also that the reason that a material separation process is not a child of material collection is that not all separations are collections (aliquoting a sample, for example . . . however some might consider this to be a collection, and consider collection to be a parent of material separation . . . but i don&apos;t think so - and recall, what is important for planned processes is their OBJECTIVE, and in this light it is clear that the colleciton objective does not apply to all separations, but the separation objective COULD apply to all collections, if interpreted liberally). 

Finally, are things like extraction or aliquoting material collections?  Intuitively I would say no but they may fit our definition . . . need to amend definition or include these?  But again, recall that planned processes are defined by their OBJECTIVES (not simply on the nature of their input and output) . . . accordingly aliquoting is clearly not a collection becasue it does not have this objective, even though it may resemble and result in the same physical output as a collection process.</obo:REO_0000192>

        <obo:REO_0000192>For the purposes of distinguishing experiments from investigations, and reagents from specimens (see discussions of reagent role), it may help to clarify more precisely the objective of an investigation.  Specifically, the goal of an investigation is to obtain &apos;knowledge&apos;, inferred from data, that is about some &apos;natural&apos; material or process.  By contrast, the objective of an assay or an experiment may be to generate data about an evaluant (in the case of an experiment this is tied to the testing of a hypothesis).  If this evaluant is an artificial&apos; / processed&apos; material such as a cell line or recombinant protein, this data is used in an investigaiton to draw conclusions about the &apos;natural&apos; entity for which this evaluant servees as a proxy.

In this way, we can say that assays and experiments generate data &apos;about&apos; the material evaluant input into these processes.  These evaluants can be &apos;natural&apos; in origin (ie liver specimens, organisms, blood samples), or &apos;artificial&apos; (ie cell lines, recombinant proteins).

Investigations, on the other hand, use data generated from their component assays and experiments to draw conclusions (ie infer knowledge) about some natural material or process.  Furthermore, investigations may have the objective of generating hypotheses, rather then testing them.

In light of these distinctions, if we define &apos;natural specimen&apos; to be the &apos;subjects about which knowledge is sought in an investigation&apos;, and allow reagents to be &apos;subjects about which data is generated in an assay or experiment&apos; (but not about which knowledge is sought), then we can say that borderline case &apos;proxies&apos; such as cell lines qualify as reagents and not &apos;natural specimens&apos;.  (Perhaps reagents can have a &apos;proxy specimen role&apos;, defined as inherieng in a material entity about which data is generated in an assay but not about which knowledge is sought in an investigation?)

As a clarifying counterpoint, a cell culture would represent a specimen: (1) on a epistemeological level, it represents a natural entity about which knoweldge is sought; (2)  on a physical level, it is comprised of molecular matter derived from some natural entity.  By contrast, a most cell lines - especially those that have existed for many years - can be said to contain no material at a molecular or atomic level that is derived from or was once a part of its original natural source.  As such, a cell line cannot be considered a specimen, but rather serves as a proxy for the original specimen from which it was taken. </obo:REO_0000192>

This is because of the fact that the inheres_in property is asserted to be functional, such that if two classes are ever asserted as the range of this property for the same domain, then it is inferred that these ranges are equivalent.  If I remove the assertion that inheres_in is funcitonal, then the reasonser does not infer the subsumbtions here.</obo:REO_0000208>
        <obo:REO_0000208>Have decided for now that research materials are not neccessarily processed materials, and thus are asserted only as children of material entity. Examples of non-processed research materials include specimens which can be observed in nature or humans observed without processing (such as humans in a study on impact of stress related jobs and heart rate).

So, while most research materials are processed, this is not always/neccessarily true (see specimen ex above . . . thus, the specimen class classified as a research material but not a processed material.</obo:REO_0000208>
        <obo:REO_0000208>This annotation is obsolete because i have unobsoleted this class - in light of the fact that we decided that not all research materials are neccessarily processed materials.  So will change the OBI:processed material that was renamed processed research material class back to &apos;processed material&apos;, and reinstitue this ReO:research material class.

Decided that, since in the scope of ReO, OBI (and probably all OBO foundry ontologies),  all material processings output a research material (since research material is defined so broadly) and are therefore equivalent to what reo intended as its material processing technique class.
 - exception might be material processings that output clinical material??

Therefore also we can say that OBI processed material is equivalent to reo:research material , and I guess we can say that all processed materials in the scope of OBI and ReO have a research material role
  - again, perhaps not all if things like clinical specimens/samples for diagnostic analysis are included . . .which they are . . . so perhaps we should change this to biomedical material with children research material or clinical material?
	
SO OBSOLETED FOR NOW BOTH REO:MATERIAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUE AND REPLACED WITH OBI MATERIAL PROCESSING (CHANGED THE LABEL TO MATERIAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUE FORE REO), AND LIKEWISE OBSOELTED REO:RESEARCH MATERIAL AND REPLACED WITH OBI:PROCESSED MATERIAL (CHANGED LABEL TO PROCESSED RESEARCH MATERIAL, AND KEPT ROLE OF RESEARCH MATERIAL ROLE)

This should help ease integration with OBI, but may have issues for using these classes beyond the realm of biomedical research, since we limit the domain/scope of these classes to entities in these domains.

        <obo:REO_0000208>The reason why amino acid analog is asserted as a subtype of organic small molecule and not a subtype of experimentally modified amino acid is because not all amino acid analogs will themseleves qualify as amino acids (ie not neccessary for an analog here to have an amine and carboxyl group). 

Otherwise, they would be a subtype of mod amino acid, since we are defining experimentally modified as being output from any material modification technique (which is any non-contextual material processing).  Accordingly, any manufactured amino acid would be experimentally modified - and since we are saying that all analogs are manufactured, (ie they are &apos;designed, and bear an artifactual function &gt; molecular analog function) then they should all be experimentally modified.

Of course, the counterargument is that a naturally occurring amino acid would be used as an analog, as analogs are defined only by a role they bear, and some agent could desire to use a natural amino acid as an analog.  But as we define things now, analog roles exploit analog functions, which are artifactual functions requiring manufacture of the bearer by some agent.

HOWEVER, NOTE THAT AMINO ACID ANALOG REAGENT IS A TYPE OF EXPERIMENTALLY MODIFIED AMINO ACID REAGENT.  THIS IS BECAUSE WE WANT TO CONSIDER AMINO ACID REAGENTS TO BE ANY AMINO ACID OR AMINO ACID ANALOG THAT HAS A REAGENT ROLE (SEE DEF ON AA REAGENT).

Natural products generally refer to a class of compounds that have, in the very least, been extracted from organisms (or parts thereof) once upon a time.

Natural Product (product of extraction) :=
(chemical compound or chemical substance)
 and has_role some (product_role that is_realized_in some biological_material_extraction)

where biological_material_extraction :=
 material_extraction that realizes some (input_role and is_role_of some (biological_entity or part_of some biological_entity)

where biological_entity := (organism, cell, tissue, organ, etc etc)

Typically, however, to be an important natural product, these exhibit biological activity 

Natural Product (biologically active product resulting from extraction of biological material ) :=
(chemical compound or chemical substance)
 and has_role some (product_role that is_realized_in some biological_material_extraction)
 and has_function some (biological_activity* that is_realized_in some biological_process*)

* we should be more specific, if possible

But we know that after they have been first discovered, they may be produced from either i) natural means, *generally* through secondary metabolic pathways and or ii) be fully synthesized in the lab.

Natural Product (source + activity) :=
(chemical compound or chemical substance)
 and has_role some (product_role that is_realized_in some (synthetic_process or (secondary_metabolism or (part_of some secondary_metabolism) or biological_material_extraction)))

        <obo:REO_0000192>Former definition was &apos;a nucleic acid sequence that is concretized in some bearer cell or organism but is not encoded in the genome of the bearer&apos; - but this implied that addition of DNA to an organism carrying the same sequence as an element of the organisms own genome would not qualify as carrying extra-genomic sequence.  We want to consider such cases to be extra-genomic, and thus the definition was changed to the current form, because we use this class to define transgenic material, and some transgenic materials contain only extra DNA which is the same as sequences found in the hosts genome - for example as is often done in overexpression studies.

Created the &apos;trans-genomic sequence&apos; class to account for the case defined in the original definition, refering to cases where the extra sequence is not found in the genome of the bearer</obo:REO_0000192>
        <obo:REO_0000795>consider however that the term &apos;extra-genomic&apos; is commonly used synonymously with &apos;epichromosomal&apos; -  to describe nucelic acid that is not physically part of the nuclear genome, and is instead found on things such as plasmids, or in mitochondria. So I may want to reconsider the label here, or consider for such &apos;non-heritable&apos; sequences to be considered as included under this class.</obo:REO_0000795>

However, it may be more correct to define a disposition to transfer molecules into cells, and use this to define the transfection reagent - this might be more consistent with our philosophy/principle of relying on roles ONLY when there is no shared disposition or function that unifies instances of a class.</obo:REO_0000192>

        <obo:REO_0000208>Note that &apos;target of material addition role&apos; and &apos;target of material component separation&apos; role are set outside the specified input/output divide, because by definition of the objectives of the processes that realize them (&apos;material combination with target objective&apos; and &apos;material component separation objective&apos;), these roles exist in a bearer as input to a process and continue to exist in the same bearer as output of the process.  This is because in these processes, the target of a material component separation or combination retains its identity through the separation or combination process, such that it still exists as the specified output afterwards (only afterwards it has gained or lost material).  

This idea of inputs retaining their identity thorugh a material transformation process is important to capture in this way because it allows us to model the notion of a material being experimentally modified vs contextually modified. </obo:REO_0000208>

        <obo:REO_0000208>Cell lines are considered reagents in ReO because in many cases they can be argued to meet the reagent definition, which requires a reagent to :

(1) be created with intent to be input into some scientific technique

(2) bear a reagent role that is realized throguh participation in (or having parts participate in) some chemical reaction during some technique.

(3) not bear an evaluant role (in the case that the technique is an assay), and not contribute significant matter to the output material (in the case that the technique is a material processing technique)  

A central argument against cell lines being reagents is in cell-based ASSAYS is that they serve as evaluants about which data is generated.  ReO acknowledges that this is true for many but not all assays.  An evaluant role for a cell line is realized in assays that generate data about materials or processes at the cellular level of granularity (ie about the cells themselves). Examples include motility assays, differentiation assays, cell death assays, etc.  By contrast, a reagent role is realized for cell lines in assays that generate data about materials or processes at a subcellular level of granularity (ie molecular/biochemical processes occurring in or around on the cells), that are ‘facilitated’ by the environment the cell provides. Examples include (a) biochemical assays about subcellular processes such as transcription, translation, protein folding, or cell signaling, (b) cell biological assays about processes such as vesicular trafficking or organelle morphogenesis, or (c) pathogen assays about the activity of pathogens in the cellular environment (e.g virus plaque assays). In these cases, the data is not about the cells, but rather the molecules or pathogens within the cells.  In such cases, the cell line realizes a reagent role.

In material processing techniques, cells are often incorporated into the specified output, but in other cases serve as reagent by facilitating the production of some separated output material.  For example, feeder cells in a cell culturing technique, or virus producing cells in techniques to generate viral stocks.  Here, cell lines realize a reagent role.</obo:REO_0000208>
        <obo:REO_0000208>Consider C Mungall definition and comments from BFO Discuss mailing list: 

&apos;cell line =def a population of cells which (1) the cells instantiate  
the same specific type, (2) are experimental artefacts cultivated in  
some medium (3) the cells are derived from the same ancestral cell or  
population of cells (4) have the quality of self-renewability&apos;

And consider additional comments on identity:

&apos;A difficult question is the identity criteria - when does one cell  
line instance become two? If a cell line instance of canonical cell  
types acquires a mutation and becomes cancerous, it changes type by  
virtue of the members of the population changing type, but is this a  
new instance linked by a transformation_of relation? (those who do  
not like their instantiation relations time-indexed would presumably  
say yes)

It would seem that best way to capture biologist usage is to treat  
&quot;HeLa cell line&quot; as the name of a cell line instance, and to have  
some other terms (&quot;portion&quot; terms perhaps) for the spatially  
connected sub-populations as may be found in a petri dish in a  
laboratory.&apos;
