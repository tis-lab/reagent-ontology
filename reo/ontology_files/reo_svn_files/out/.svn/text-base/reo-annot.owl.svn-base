1. &#39;molecular reporter role&#39;, inhereing in a &#39;molecular reporter&#39; that  emits some detectable signal and is incorporated covalently into a probe or analyte.  Examples include a radioactive P33 atom incorporated into an aligonucleotide probe, a fluorochrome covalently linked to an antibody probe, a GFP tag linked to a recombinant protein, a radioactive S35 atom incorporated into methionine residues of a protein

2. a &#39;molecular probe role&#39;, inhereing in a &#39;molecular probe&#39; that non-covalently binds a molecular target and links an analyte with a reporter).  Examples include an oligonucleotide probe used to target its complementary sequence in a FISH assay, and antibody used to target a specific protein in a immunhohistochemical assay.

3. A &#39;stain role&#39;, inhereing in a molecular stain or dye, that non-covalently binds to an analyte and emits a detectable colorimetric or fluorescent signal.  Examples include toluidine blue (a blue stain that that targets heparin to detect mast cells in histochemistry), DAPI stain (binds to DNA and fluoresces under UV light), and Ponceau S stain (a red stain which binds generally to protein).

4. a &#39;tracker&#39; role, inhereing in a moleculr tracker that covalently binds to an analyte or probe, and does not emit a detectable signal.  Examples include biotin incorporated into a oligonucleotide probe, or a FLAG epitope tag incorporated into a recombinant protein.</obo:REO_0000208>

 (ReO proposes two changes: First is to remove the necessity that a specimen be intended for use in an investigation, as this is very often not the case.  Furthermore, OBI already uses an evaluant role for entities that are intended subjects of an assay, such that the specimen role as defined in OBI seems redundant.  ReO implements the specimen role such that it is gained upon an agent’s intent to collect it instead of upon it’s collection, and is realized upon its collection and not its input in an investigation.  

Second is to change the label of the ‘specimen creation’ class to ‘specimen collection’, as according to our definition, all specimens are outputs of some collection process.  This second change may not be required, however, if we say that specimens can be derived from other specimens, in which case the derivation process that creates a specimen is not a collection process.

If it is determined that specimens can be created in the absence of some collection process, then we can use the ReO:specimen creation class (defined as has_specified_output some specimen) as an equivalent class to subsume the specimen collection process along with other processes that generate specimens.  This would also mean that we cannot say a specimen role is gained in a collection process.)</obo:REO_0000208>

All material inputs into some investigation, experiment, or technique described in this ontology should be asserted to have some kind of research material role (a reagent role, a specimen role, a scientific instrument or device role, or a research agent role) (unless they hold an axiom that they are the specified output of some technique, which also qualifies them as research material). This is important for the reasoner to classify the planned processes used to generate research materials as &#39;material processing techniques&#39;, which is defined as having output some research material (the fact this is a &#39;technique&#39; necessitates that any material output bears a research material role).  For example, in order for &#39;cell culturing technique&#39; and &#39;molecular labeling technique&#39; to classify as a material procesing technique, I needed to add a &#39;specimen role&#39;  to cell culture and a &#39;research material role&#39; to &#39;labeled material&#39;.

CARO 

7-6-11: replace with CARO2 definition/class when available.  It remains unclear if this definition will require anatomical entities to be part of some organism, or only that they derive from some organism in some specified way (ie does derives from require only that it was part of an organism, or that it (or some portion of it?) results from the coordinated expression of an organism&#39;s own geneome, or that it can result from the coordinated expression of an organism&#39;s genome or that of any organism that is part of the organism (to account for anatomical structures such as virally-induced tumors) ).  

Definitions of some terms such as &#39;cell in vivo&#39; may have to be modified depending on the outcome of these decisions.)

11-4-11: &#39;material anatomical entity&#39; in CARO will refer to all anatomical entities from organism down to cell (and subcellular structures?).  CARO:gross anatomical part (child of anatomical entity) will encompass anatomical entities BELOW organism to ABOVE cell. This is equivalent to the OBI:anatomical structure class.  A CARO material anatomical entity needs to be part of or located in an organism, (and does not need to derive from the coordinated expression of an organisms genome - such that feces and urine are anatomical entities).  For now, ReO will follow CARO in treating cells and organisms as material anatomical entities - and thus use this imported class.  But for purposes of integration with OBI, may want to use thier approach and import only gross anatomical entity from CARO, and keep organism and cell outside of this branch.</obo:REO_0000208>

        <obo:REO_0000513>Explanation of Roles Realized Through Three Squential Techniques:

1. A Material Processing Technique (Generation of a Labeled Antibody)
In a antibody labeling technique, the antibody and fluorochrome play incorporant roles (primary and secondary incorporant roles, respectively), and any coupling or elution buffers used play reagent roles.

2. An Assay (Determining Degree of Labeling)
In an assay to determine the efficiency of labeling of the antibody, the labeled antibody plays an evaluant role, the fluorochrome plays an analyte role, and any buffers used in the assay play reagent roles

3. An Assay (Detecting Expression Level and Location of a Protein of Interest)
In a immunocytochemicsty assay, the cells play an evaluant role, the endogenous protein of interest plays an analyte role, and the molecular labels (labeled antibody probe, fluorescent reporter), as well as any buffers, fixatives, and detergents used, play reagent roles.

This example illustrates how a given material entity (an antibody or fluorochrome) can bear many different research material roles (an incorporant role, an evaluant role, a reagent role), and how these roles are realized in different processes.</obo:REO_0000513>

        <obo:REO_0000208>We changed our minds on the below, and thus have reinstated the distinction between ReO material processing technique and OBI material processing, creating classes for each.

We have decided for now to import the OBI material processing class and change label to material processing technique, as for our purposes all material processings in the scope of ReO and OBi (and likely all of the OBO foundry), have specified outputs of research materials (thus making them all reo:material processing techniques as we originally conceived of this class).  So to ease integration with OBI, the OBI material processing class was re-used here in this way, with a modified definition and additional axioms, including an extended logical definition to include the statement that the output must be a research materisl (which i beleive to be consistent with the implicit meaning of this class in OBI)

So, in ReO, this class is used to subsume all techniques that generate or prepare materials for potential use in an investigation (ie via synthesis, collection, purification, etc).  Investigations here are considered broadly to include any planned processes aimed at producing information of a scientific nature, including activities as simple as collecting and storing a specimen for visual observation, where the visual observation is a type of scientific analysis where data about the physical properties of the specimen are gathered and analyzed.</obo:REO_0000208>

        <obo:REO_0000208>Have decided for now that research materials are not neccessarily processed materials, and thus are asserted only as children of material entity. Examples of non-processed research materials include specimens which can be observed in nature or humans observed without processing (such as humans in a study on impact of stress related jobs and heart rate).

So, while most research materials are processed, this is not always/neccessarily true (see specimen ex above . . . thus, the specimen class classified as a research material but not a processed material.</obo:REO_0000208>
        <obo:REO_0000208>This annotation is obsolete because i have unobsoleted this class - in light of the fact that we decided that not all research materials are neccessarily processed materials.  So will change the OBI:processed material that was renamed processed research material class back to &#39;processed material&#39;, and reinstitue this ReO:research material class.

Decided that, since in the scope of ReO, OBI (and probably all OBO foundry ontologies),  all material processings output a research material (since research material is defined so broadly) and are therefore equivalent to what reo intended as its material processing technique class.
 - exception might be material processings that output clinical material??

Therefore also we can say that OBI processed material is equivalent to reo:research material , and I guess we can say that all processed materials in the scope of OBI and ReO have a research material role
  - again, perhaps not all if things like clinical specimens/samples for diagnostic analysis are included . . .which they are . . . so perhaps we should change this to biomedical material with children research material or clinical material?
	
SO OBSOLETED FOR NOW BOTH REO:MATERIAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUE AND REPLACED WITH OBI MATERIAL PROCESSING (CHANGED THE LABEL TO MATERIAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUE FORE REO), AND LIKEWISE OBSOELTED REO:RESEARCH MATERIAL AND REPLACED WITH OBI:PROCESSED MATERIAL (CHANGED LABEL TO PROCESSED RESEARCH MATERIAL, AND KEPT ROLE OF RESEARCH MATERIAL ROLE)

This should help ease integration with OBI, but may have issues for using these classes beyond the realm of biomedical research, since we limit the domain/scope of these classes to entities in these domains.

        <obo:REO_0000208>Cell lines are considered reagents in ReO because in many cases they can be argued to meet the reagent definition, which requires a reagent to :

(1) be created with intent to be input into some scientific technique

(2) bear a reagent role that is realized throguh participation in (or having parts participate in) some chemical reaction during some technique.

(3) not bear an evaluant role (in the case that the technique is an assay), and not contribute significant matter to the output material (in the case that the technique is a material processing technique)  

A central argument against cell lines being reagents is in cell-based ASSAYS is that they serve as evaluants about which data is generated.  ReO acknowledges that this is true for many but not all assays.  An evaluant role for a cell line is realized in assays that generate data about materials or processes at the cellular level of granularity (ie about the cells themselves). Examples include motility assays, differentiation assays, cell death assays, etc.  By contrast, a reagent role is realized for cell lines in assays that generate data about materials or processes at a subcellular level of granularity (ie molecular/biochemical processes occurring in or around on the cells), that are ‘facilitated’ by the environment the cell provides. Examples include (a) biochemical assays about subcellular processes such as transcription, translation, protein folding, or cell signaling, (b) cell biological assays about processes such as vesicular trafficking or organelle morphogenesis, or (c) pathogen assays about the activity of pathogens in the cellular environment (e.g virus plaque assays). In these cases, the data is not about the cells, but rather the molecules or pathogens within the cells.  In such cases, the cell line realizes a reagent role.

In material processing techniques, cells are often incorporated into the specified output, but in other cases serve as reagent by facilitating the production of some separated output material.  For example, feeder cells in a cell culturing technique, or virus producing cells in techniques to generate viral stocks.  Here, cell lines realize a reagent role.</obo:REO_0000208>

        <obo:REO_0000208>When adding/modeling material processing classes in ReO, be sure to indicate with an axiom when the output of the process is a processed material and has a research material role, so that it will classify as a material processing technique (since research materials are now no longer a subclass of processed material, it does not work to assert that a process has an output of a research material for it to classify as a material processing technique  - 

ACTUALLY, IT DOES :  but the converse is not true - ie that a research material can be defined as being output of a material processing techninque)

All material processings that are techniques should be asserted under material processing technique, and inferred to be material processing techniques based on having an output that is a processed material that has a research material role.  NO - instead I will assert material processing techniques under material processing technique, and say that a material processing technique has output only some research material.  then I could say that a research material is anything that has a research material role or is output of a material processing technique.  As a result, i would not have to worry about developers having to indicate axiomatically that material processings with an output that is a research material &#39;has_specified_output some (has_role some &#39;research material role&#39;))&#39;  (and I could remove all such existing axioms) . . . which seems more convenient.  The burden then is on developers to be sure to assert material processings that have research material outputs as material processing techniques (which should be easy, as nearly all material processings in OBi and ReO are techniques.  

With this new approach, things will be inferred to be a research material based on their being output from a material processing technique, instead of the reverse (things being inferred to be techniques based on their having a outputs that have a research material role.  I think this is more useful and intuitive to expect developers to model and users to understand.

What implicaitons would this new approach have if I decide to elim the material processing technique class and jsut use OBI material processing . . .then I would have a situation where a research material is defined as being output of a material processing - which is not correct.  So be aware of the issues this could cause.</obo:REO_0000208>

unobsoleted on 11-9-11 because i changed mind about not needing this class

-obsoleted reo:material processing technique class (included removing logical def : &#39;planned process&#39; and (has_specified_output some &#39;research material&#39;) and axiom: achieves_planned_objective some &#39;material processing objective&#39;, and changed label of OBI:material processing to &#39;material processing technique&#39; . . . 

as BP suggested - since really all material processings in scope of OBI (and indeed of obo foundry) have output that are research materials . . .and simply renaming this OBI class and adding axioms that make it classify undre reo:technique is an easier modleing solution, partic for integrating with OBI down the road.</obo:REO_0000208>

        <obo:REO_0000208>Definition when this was &#39;molecular analog reagent role:
&#39;a reagent role inhering in a synthetic molecular entity that is designed to exhibit structural similarity to a naturally occurring molecule.  This similarity is such that the bearer can mimic some chemical or biological activity of this molecular entity, while also exhibiting specified structural differences that allow it to probe or alter the molecular environment of the bearer in some way.</obo:REO_0000208>

        <obo:REO_0000208>(removed this axiom for now, because the immunization is not a part of the immunization technique - it follows it - therefore the immunization protocol would not specify the occurrence of an immunization process)

Note here that we cannot say that an immunization technique necessarily results_in some immunization (becasue not all will successfuly trigger an adaptive immune response).  So if we want to link the immunization technique to the biological process of immunization that we INTEND it to initiate, we test out the design pattern below : 

&#39;immunization technique&#39; achieves_specification some (specifies_occurrence_of some immunization)

This could be condensed to some shortcut relation such as &#39;intended to result in&#39;?</obo:REO_0000208>
